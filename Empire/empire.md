# An Empire if You Can Keep It


## We Could not Keep It

When Elizabeth Willing Powel encountered Benjamin Franklin exiting the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia,
she reportedly asked him, "Well, Doctor, what have we got, a republic or a monarchy?"

He answered her, "A republic, if you can keep it."

We were not able to keep it. At some point in the nineteenth century, certainly by the time we took possesion of Puerto
Rico and the Philippines, we had become an empire. This sort of thing has happened before. History offers us no
evidence that the process is reversible.

I swam competitively for a number of years. I achieved my best times at about the age of 25 or so.
I would love to be able to swim that fast again, and it's an entertaining fantasy to imagine that I could.

But it's just that: a fantasy. Well I might be able to get in better shape than I am today, I cannot undo 41 years of
aging. My body will never perform like it was 25 again, at least until the final resurrection.

Hoping to get back to the republic of the 1820s (or whatever other era the defender of small-r republicanism idealizes)
is like me hoping to match my swimming times from when I was 25. It's an attractive fantasy, but it's not
going to happen.

The fact of the matter is that America is today a global empire. While nostalgic longing for some republican era of the
past is understandable, actually pinning one's hopes on a revivification of that corpse is not healthy.

And we have a very good cautionary example of the danger involved at the close of the Roman Republic. As I described in
*Oakeshott on Rome and America*, the spirit that had animated the Roman Republic had been well dissipated by the time of
Julius Caesar's ascendancy. There was no realistic possibility of restoring the old republic.

Brutus, Cassius, and Cato are often potrayed as civic heroes in our literature. In fact, their inability to recognize
that their imagined republic could not be realized led to years of civil war, and even made the situation worse for
themselves and all their supporters. Julius Caesar, after taking power, was willing to make peace with *Optimates*,
forgiving those who had opposed him and leaving them their ???.

In gratitude, the *Optimates* assasinated Caesar. As a consequence they faced the second triumvirate of Octavius, Marc Antony, and
Lepidus, who, having learned the lesson that their opponents could not be trusted, had them killed, drove them to
suicide, or robbed them of all their possesions and left them destitute.

Analyzing that situation using Vilfredo Pareto's theory of (the circulation of elites)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulation_of_elites]
is informative: the *Optimates* were a declining elite who were trying to retain their elite status,
while the *Populares* were a rising elite. The first *Populare* to take power, Julius Caesar, offered the members of the
declining elite an olive branch. Failing to recognize that this was the best offer they were going to get, the
*Optimates* rejected his offer, and instead were wiped out.




## A Non-Ideological Empire


The Romans did not have to ideologically defeat every culture they brought into their empire. They only required that
they acknowledged the empire's sovereignty.

Americans should really just acknowledge that their government rules an empire, and the government folks might admit it as well.

Then the question would become, "How can we rule this empire most prudently and justly?"

And at that point we'd be having a genuine discussion.


The one failing of their tolerance was the Christians. And that was because Christianity, because of its strict monotheism, did not permit its
adherents to pay homage to the ancient gods of the Roman polity. The many polytheistic societies Rome had conquered were
allowed to keep all of their local gods and traditional rites, so long as they added into those the appropriate civil
performance of homage to the Roman gods.


Jewish monotheism escaped the fate of Christianity because it was old, clearly older than Rome, and the Romans
respected things that had endured. (They had an early understanding of the Lindy effect.)

But besides that one large faling, the Romans in general did not concern themselves with how the residents of some
conquered territory conducted their lives: they could 


## An Empire That Hides Its Reality Behind an Ideology


Wilson

Spreading democracy


Many of the adherents of Wilsonianism were sincere. But the problem is that 

constantly punished if democracy is not spreading, and that locale..


How much the actors in this play intended result, what, in fact, happened, was that the states meeting the "democratic,
liberal capitalist" criterion became dependent upon US defense.


## The Benefits


Trump is casting off Europe as part of the American Empire.



## Objections

### It Is Better to Be Hypocritical Than Unashamedly Bad





### The State Should Guide Us Morally


Ideally, of course, but recently, the states main role in that area has been to misguide us morally.

If the rulers of our empire recognized its proper role as currently best institution for preventing widespread violence
and anarchy, they would understand that leaving local parts of the empire alone as much as possible is one of the best
ways to fulfill there stewardship, as well as lessening resistance to their rule.





## Notes



If we admit we have an empire, we might be able to define its borders so others would know when they were stepping across them.



Ahmari:

"One rift inside the foreign-policy restraint camp is between:

(A) Jeffersonian small-r republicans;

(B) essentially American primacists who believe in pursuing different priorities than those long preferred by liberal Atlanticists.

I have some (A) in me, but mostly I'm a (B)."



Maybe: 

Of course: because "international law" is a just an international suggestion without an international sovereign ready to enforce that law.


There is no true law, in the city of man, without a sovereign to enforce that law.

"international law" is a just an international suggestion without an international sovereign ready to enforce that law.
