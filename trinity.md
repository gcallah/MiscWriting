# A Meditation on the Algorithm as an Image for the Trinity

The idea of the Trinity, while central to Christianity, has proven a tough
pill for non-Christians to swallow. To Jewish and Muslim monotheists, it often
seems a re-admission of pagan polytheism into polite, Abrahamic society.
On the other hand, to many sceptics, it simply says something ridiculous 
like 1 = 3. On the other hand, as prominent a philosopher as R.G. Collingwood,
in *An Essay on Metaphysics*, contended that the doctrine of the Trinity was 
the philosophical solution to the metaphysical crisis that was destroying the
pagan world, and pagan science along with it,and that this doctrine "has been the main
or fundamental presuppositions of natural science ever since" (1984: ???).


Therefore, for those who don't find this symbol either regressive or absurd,
it may be worthwhile to seek out metaphors that can render it more comprehensible.
The English novelist, translator, and theologian Dorothy Sayers found art
to supply a illuminating analogy. She devoted an entire book
to that topic (*The Mind of the Maker*), so a short excerpt cannot do her work justice,
but can give us a flavor of what she did:

"For every work [or act] of creation is threefold, an earthly trinity to match
the heavenly.

"First, [not in time, but merely in order of enumeration] there is the Creative
Idea, passionless, timeless, beholding the whole work complete at once, the end
in the beginning: and this is the image of the Father.

"Second: there is the Creative Energy [or Activity] begotten of that idea,
working in time from the beginning to the end, with sweat and passion, being
incarnate in the bonds of matter: and this is the image of the Word.

"Third: there is the Creative Power, the meaning of the work and its response
in the lively soul: and this is the image of the indwelling Spirit.

"And these three are one, each equally in itself the whole work, whereof none
can exist without other: and this is the image of the Trinity." (2004: 28)


I was struck by the possibility of using the concept of an algorithm,
in a fashion similar to how Sayers had used art, while lecturing on computer
science.
As I taught my students the Sieve of Eratosthenes, I described the sieve
verbally, then I had them "run" the sieve on paper, then program it in Visual
Basic. And as I did so, I contemplated, "What is the sieve itself, apart from
its implementations?"

This of course is but one more version of the problem that Plato and Aristotle
grappled with, on the relation of the forms to their particulars. Plato's
approach was to regard the particulars as inferior "copies" of the forms, which
tended to lead to a contempt for the world of particulars, and Gnostic ideas
like the creation of the sensible world by an evil demiurge. On the other hand,
Aristotle emphasized the particulars, leading him to posit a God who was so
totally removed from the world that He did not even know it existed.

The problem, it seemed to me as I contemplated this matter, is that each view
is one-sided, and treats the algorithm and its implementations as though they
could be pulled apart. But the implementations are meaningless except as
implementations of the form. We might understand this by saying that the
"algorithm itself" is the generative source of the implementations. But it is
not something different from those implementations, nor did it stamp them out,
as though on an assembly line. We might say the implementations of the form are
one in being with the form, and that they are begotten, not made by it.

Furthermore, we finite beings are only able to perceive the form itself through
the implementations. There is simply no way to convey to anyone else what the
generative form of the algorithm is without pointing them to the form fleshed
out in an implementation, or, we might say, as humans, our only path to the
generative source is through the source made flesh.

But we might further notice that we haven't completed our analysis of this
matter just yet: neither the generative form nor its implementation are
complete without the actual running of the algorithm, until we give it life by
executing it, on paper, or in our head, or on a computer. The generative form
is made fully real through its implementations by the power of executing it.
But that power is also one in being with the form and the implementations: we
might say the execution of an algorithm proceeds from its generative form and
its implementation.

The logos is complete in eternity, but unfolds gradually through time through
the action of the Holy Spirit.
