# Did Tocqueville foresee America's current malaise?

## Abstract

In a *Commonweal* symposium on Patrick Deneen's *Why Liberalism Failed*, both
Deneen's critics, 
Samuel Moyn and Bryan Garsten of Yale University,
and  Deneen himself, focus an unusual amount of attention on how to correctly
interpret Alexis de Tocqueville's famous work, *Democracy in America*. Deneen again features Tocqueville
in a recent post on the *Postliberal Order* substack (2023).

Why, nearly 200 years after its publication, does this work still hold such
sway in discussing American politics? Well, for one thing, Tocqueville offered
certain prognoses that seem almost prophetic: that the expansion of the 
British population of North America across the continent was nearly inevitable,
or that the two great powers of the future would be the United States and
Russia.

But what is more important, in terms of "looking backward to move forward," are
Tocqueville's comments on the weaknesses and strengths of American democracy.
How many of the roots of our current malaise were already present when
Tocqueville toured the US? If the answer is, "Most of them," then it is not
useful to point the finger at Wilson, or FDR, or "the 60s," as bearing the
brunt of the blame for our current condition.

Therefore, re-examining the work of perhaps the greatest observer of American
democracy should prove helpful in our present situation.

## Introduction


## The Modern Litany of Sorrows

Numerous writers, I have placed the blame for America's current woeful state on various events in history. I will only
sign a few here, but I could have assembled dozens of sides for each point of blame.


### The Constitution

Perhaps the real root of our dificulties lies in the defeat of the anti-federalists by the supporters of the new US
Constitution? Such a view is forwarded by Murray Rothbard, as described in Gordon (2020).




### The Civil War

Hummel contens that while the Civil War emancipated slaves, it also enslaved free men (2014).

### The Progressives

Or perhaps Woodrow Wilson and other early 20th-century progressives are to blame for how America has gone wrong? (E.g.,
Evers, 2015).


### The New Deal


### The Great Society


### Neoliberalism

Robert Putnam notes the decline of local social groupings in his 2014 work *Bowling Alone*.


### The Boomers

Helen Andrews lays the blame for our current plight squarely on "the boomers" (2021). Of course, such an analysis raises
the question, if the "boomers" are so aweful... what about the parents that raised them?


## Did Tocqueville Foresee the Above? (Most of it? Any of it?)

As Deneen writes, "Both ignore Tocqueville's insistence -- especially in Volume Two of Democracy in America -- on the
inexorable logic of “democracy” toward individualism, materialism, “restlessness,” short-term thinking, and a kind of
civic infantilism fostered by a tutelary state" (2018, par. 2) 


Deneen again:
"As Tocqueville predicted of liberal democracy, individualism would be its primary fruit: 'Not only does democracy make
each man forget his ancestors, but it hides his descendants from him and separates him from his contemporaries; it
constantly leads him back toward himself alone and threatens finally to confine him wholly in the solitude of his own
heart'" (2023, par. 1).
