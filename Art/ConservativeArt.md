# Against "Conservative Art"


In a recent piece,
["TV Is Always Progressive"](https://americanmind.org/features/a-matter-of-taste/tv-is-always-progressive/),
Mary Harrington writes: "By contrast, if by 'art' you understand (as I do) a fusion of moral, aesthetic and
political impulses..."

Now, in general, I am a great admirer of Harrington's work, but here I think she has missed the mark.
I do not deny that often a miscellany of activities is going on nearly simultaneously
in some person's life. One may be making love to one's spouse, while also watching a golf tournament on TV, and planning
that evening's dinner. But that does not mean that making love *consists* of a "fusion" of those various activities.
(And what would such a "fusion" even be?) Similarly,
someone may be painting, while alternately attending to aesthetic, political, and moral ends. But that no more makes
such a miscellany the differentia of art than does the previous miscellany represent the differentia of sexual intercourse.
What, then, *does* differentiate art from other human activities?

In an essay titled "The Voice of Poetry in the Conversation of Mankind," Michael Oakeshott says of "poetry," by which he
means artistic activity, that its essential character is to take contemplative delight in the conceptual image
that work of art presents. He writes that "images in contemplation are merely present... [they are]
neither pleasurable [inciting desire] nor painful [inciting aversion];
and [they do] not attract... either moral approval or disapproval.

But this understanding of art is to be found much earlier, in fact, at least as far back as Aquinas.
For a brief synopsis of the Aquinas's understanding of art, let us turn to James Joyce's *A Portrait of the Artist as a
Young Man*:

"The tragic emotion, in fact, is a face looking two ways, towards terror and towards pity, both of which are phases of
it. You see I use the word arrest. I mean that the tragic emotion is static. Or rather the dramatic emotion is. The
feelings excited by improper art are kinetic, desire or loathing. Desire urges us to possess, to go to something;
loathing urges us to abandon, to go from something. The arts which excite them, pornographical or didactic, are
therefore improper arts. The esthetic emotion (I used the general term) is therefore static. The mind is arrested and
raised above desire and loathing."

It might be helpful to clarify what Aquinas means as Joyce understands him. "Proper" art does not mean art that respects
boundaries of propriety, but art achieving a properly artistic end: that of contemplation of the artistic image itself.
It is "proper" in the same sense as driving a nail into wood is the proper use of a hammer. Pornographic art, in
contrast, moves us emotionally to desire or loathe its image: when we call TV programs showing fabulous homes
"real estate porn" we are recognizing Aquinas's point. Didactic art also achieves the same effect, but by attempting to
intellectually, rather than emotionally, convince us that we should desire or loathe its subject. *Aesop's Fables*
come to mind here.

But why can't someone do both at once, try to make the case for some political cause while also producing an excellent
work of art?  Well, because no man may serve two masters. Imagine you are the manager of an NBA basketball team; you set the
team the simultaneous goals of:

1. Winning the NBA championship
2. Hiring as many disabled players as possible.

It should be clear that to the extent you focus on one of these goals, you are less likely to succeed at the other. And
so it is with someone creating a novel, or a play, or a painting: to the extent their focus is on making a case for
some political cause, it is not on making great art.

Conservative art is bad not because conservatives have "terrible taste" (as Harrington would have it),
or lack imagination, but because the very term shows
it to be a mongrel beast of low breeding: art is its own species, as is politics, but
"conservative art" tries to force them to
produce fertile offspring. "Progressive art" of course has the exact same problem: it merely has the advantage over
conservative art in being fashionable. To the extent that progressive art is actually "better" than
conservative art, I think it is largely the effect of ambition: for a budding artist with talent, it will be obvious that
mixing progressivism with their art will advance them in their profession, while even a whiff of conservatism could
end their career.


There is nothing preventing someone of conservative political inclinations from producing great art, except the
misapprehension that their art must somehow support conservative politics. And so may someone of progressive political
inclination produce great art. Nevertheless, conservatives may actually have an advantage here, in that at least some
varieties of conservatives are less committed to the idea that everything must have political implications than are most
progressives.


None of this is to say that even the greatest artists do not mingle non-aesthetic concerns into their art, nor am I trying to
set up some rule that they should never do so. In fact, perhaps a certain sprinkling of non-aesthetic bits throughout a
work of art serve to enhance its aesthetic character, in the same way that a few bits of anchovie may make an otherwise
edible salad more interesting. 


If someone of a conservative disposition wishes to produce excellent art that, in a certain sense, supports
conservatism, the best thing they can do is to focus simply on producing excellent art. And this will illustrate the point
that conservatives are not entirely obsessed with politics, as many progressives are.
