AI and Semiotics


Various sceptical authors have addressed question of whether AI genuinely is thinking now, or will ever think. While I think that many of their arguments are perfectly sound, they involve first getting the reader to engage in some metaphysical thinking.

But the discipline of semiotics provides a way to demonstrate that there is a fundamental gulf between the way a human interacts with the world and the way a machine does so. That is because humans do not interact with the world in strictly dyadic relationships: they exhibit Peirce’s “thirdness,” which, as he demonstrated, cannot be decomposed into simpler, dyadic relationships.

But computers, even when executing programs that may be called "artificial intelligence,” exhibit only dyadic relationships: their output is literally meaningless until it enters into a relationship of thirdness with a human being.




What are computer outputs as a string of zeros and ones. It only refers to anything else when humans treat it as so referring. It is we who decide what computer doing is "playing music," and so we send the outfit to a speaker, or “painting," and so we send the output to the screen or a color, printer, or "writing," and so we take the string of ones and zeros and turn them into letters and punctuation marks.




The meaning of what our thoughts cannot be found in a pattern of neural activity. That is because, as computers have demonstrated, the exact same patterns of electrical impulses can be given many different meetings: the same program that, hooked up to a graphic display, will produce a light show, when hooked up to some audio equipment, could produce a musical composition.



One could suppose that people who could suggest an idea such as "consciousness is an illusion” might try here, claiming that meaning does not actually exist. But then, one wonders what to make of their effort to write books that purport to be filled with meaning.


All the “brain” of a computer can ever “see” is patterns of voltages. (we humans typically call these ones and zeros, but that is just a convenience we adopt for our sake.)


Physical activity of neurons in our brain is obviously connected to our thoughts. But these considerations show that they cannot be identical with our thoughts, since thoughts are about meanings, and no such electrical pattern can ever uniquely determine a meaning.


Anything you input to a computer simply has to be translated into nothing more than a pattern of high and low voltages, or it will not affect the state of the computer at all.


Such a pattern of ones and zeros might reflect the structure of the radiation coming from a binary star system. But it might also reflect the structure of the earnings of seniors in Pompano Beach Florida


If the astronomers and the mayor of Pompano Beach accidentally swapped files nothing would change. 

And even the binary output of whatever program the astronomers were running and that of the city government of Pompano Beach might, by sheer coincidence, contain the exact same bit patterns .

Give an example of a bit pattern for a letter or a number 


If we interpret a low-voltage is true, then an XOR gate becomes a gate to test for equality

The church Turing thesis tells us that every digital computer has the same essential capabilities.



Someone might claim that the water system is too slow a character characterized as intelligent. This relies on some theory of intelligence not as getting the answer right but as delivering the right answer quickly. I do not know that any such theory has been put forth.
