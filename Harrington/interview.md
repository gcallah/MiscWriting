Gene Callahan: I've become convinced that turning an oral interview into a text is a process of translation. It's a lot
like taking a novel to film or something like that.

When I look at the original transcript, what you've got is, someone gets asked a question, and they respond
"Well, the thing is, I once... no, no, no, let's not go into that. It's, you know, maybe I should..."
No one needs to be reading that stream of pauses and hemming and hawing.

Gene Callahan: So, I've become convinced that...

[Muffled sound from Mary's end.]

Sorry, go ahead.

Mary Harrington: No, I was just calling the dog.

Gene Callahan: Oh, alright. I thought you wanted *me* to heel.

Mary Harrington: No, no,.

Gene Callahan: So what I do is, I've given each person I've interviewed the edited transcript, and I try to be very scrupulous
and making sure I'm conveying what they were thinking, and they can tell me if I've misrepresented anything.

Mary Harrington: Cool.

Gene Callahan: In any case, that provides us with a nice segue into the first topic I want to discuss with you, which
turns around the difference between a culture that is primarily oral and one that is highly literate.

So, how did print change human lives?

Mary Harrington: I literally just finished writing a chapter about that today, at least I think I finished it. I *hope*
I finished it. It's sort of difficult to start to say anything very comprehensive about this succinctly, because it
changed everything. I mean, I've titled the chapter The Modernity Machine, because in my view, the printing press is...
it's the foundational technology of modernity.  You know, which is itself a vague term. I mean, your magazine is called
*Modern Age*, but what precisely do you mean by modern? You know, you can go down a whole philosophical rabbit hole with
that.

Gene Callahan: Yeah, well, I didn't name it, so...

Mary Harrington: It's like, you know it when you see it, right? There's an indefinable thing that happens. There's a
sort of this-ness which comes into being, and people sort of wave their arms around and talk about the spirit of the
age, or, you know, transformation of ideas and a genealogy of this or that.  And I find Elizabeth Eisenstein, who's an
historian, persuasive in her argument that actually what almost all of these
histories of ideas leave out or simply take for granted is the material contribution of print to all of
these changes.

I sent the chapter to a friend earlier this evening, saying it was just an absolute headache to write.
It was like trying to get an octopus into a fishnet stocking.

There's probably still tentacles flopping around where there shouldn't be, just generally. It's a very unruly subject, because...

Gene Callahan: Wait a second: You've tried to put an octopus in a fishnet stocking?

Mary Harrington: I wanted to convey the sense of
elusiveness and slipperiness and just general things... things thrashing around where... in ways I didn't want them to.
So no, it's not something I've ever tried, but I hope it's evocative.

I've tried to throw out some thematic key points in this particular chapter. You see, I've already... I've already
failed to do this succinctly, because this is just impossible to do succinctly. What
Eisenstein points to are two characteristics of print as a form which were transformative.
So it wasn't just that the ideas carried by print changed things, but
although they did, it was also two characteristics of print as a form, distinct from handwriting, which was the
prevalent information technology of the manuscript age, which were world-transforming. One of them was scale. There was
just a lot more reading material than previously, and that had all sorts of complex feedback loop effects.
And the other effect was fixity.
And between them, those two material attributes of print as a form, they invented progress. And the advancement of
knowledge just wasn't a thing prior to the printing press.

Because, you know, books would get eaten by insects, or muddled, garbled in translation. You couldn't copy diagrams. You
know, it simply wasn't possible to do accurate science, because how many ignorant copyists do you think can reproduce an
intricate diagram of an aorta before it's just unrecognizable?

It's not until you have woodcuts or engravings that any sort of accurate pictorial representations become possible. So
there are entire vistas of human knowledge which can be sort of catalogued and developed and worked on in a sort of
collaborative, distributive way. And that only becomes possible through print.

I think it's my thesis, although I wasn't really in the weeds on this today, my working hypothesis is that
there were a concurrent set of transformations in the prevailing culture, and really in the
the mindset of individuals within that culture more plainly, it changed how people thought.

Literacy as such, well, there's pretty good evidence that it just changes people at a fundamental level, and sort of
irreversibly as well. The literate brain is different to the non-literate brain, in a
way which, once you've seen it, once you can parse the
little symbols, you can't unread them later. You can't forget how to do that without some sort of significant brain
damage.

And once you... and again, this theme of scale, once you scale that up to a very much larger proportion of the
population, something fundamental changes about what that culture is like, and how that culture approaches reality, and
all sorts of things, from sort of time and memory.

And what constitutes knowledge, what constitutes reality, how you conceive time, or history, and many other things,
all changed, not overnight, but over a period of many years.

Part of my thesis is that the inflection point for a lot of these changes, and the three in particular that I wanted to look at,
which are nation-state, democracy in the 17th century, at least in the English-speaking world, and

left us with a settlement, the broad outlines of which, albeit with some contestation, we've had more or less since... until recently.
And now, the digital revolution is really undoing a lot of those changes.
And I think we're now embarking on a very interesting period where we doing the 17th century again, but in reverse.


Gene Callahan: I had been reviewing your recent Substack posts, So these ideas were in my mind one day when I was
watching American football with my son.
There's this very elaborate little dance a receiver does catching a pass where they have to get both feet inbounds. 
And I said to him, "Could you imagine our ancestors finding out that this would be a really highly paid skill, that you
could catch a ball and then do this little intricate dance with your feet.

And he replied, "Well, we've always had sports."

And I said, "Yes, but, until recently, we never had sports with intricate rulebooks. A sport would be, for instance, you
two people chuck this javelin, and whoever chucks it furthest wins."

It's only with print that you can have sports with 200-page rulebooks that the referees are supposed to master, and the
players and coaches as much as they can. So, even with something as mundane as how a sport is played, this
transformation radically changed things.

Mary Harrington: Yes, absolutely. I mean, you can trace that genealogy, actually, back through English football.
English football originated back in unknown, illiterate times. There's a game called Shrovetide football, with basically has no rules at all,
apart from two goals, a mile or more apart, and a roundish object, and then the rest of it is basically just barely
contained rioting, where two very sort of loosely demarcated sides sort of have a riot and try and get the ball to...
the... to their preferred end. Everyone drinks a lot of beer, and it's basically a sort of minimally, minimally
constrained, opportunity to just have a big, enjoyable, beery fight. It's still played once a year on Shrovete, in the
north of England.

==================

QUESTION: Wikipedia claims the game is played in Ashbourne. Is that right?

==================


Gene Callahan: We actually, in my grammar school game much like that, and on an asphalt parking lot.
But no beer: the nuns wouldn't allow it.


Mary Harrington: There are variants! Unsupervised little boys will reverse engineer a version of this,
because that's sort of deep in their DNA.

Mary Harrington: Oh.

Bob Bermuda Triangle, I forgot. I'm on a footpath which goes through a little Bermuda Triangle, for some reason. I don't know. Hopefully, hopefully I'll pick up again once I pass it. Tell me, can you hear me all right? Yeah, this is good.

Gene Callahan: So what did radio and television do to the world created by print?

Mary Harrington: Your man for this is not me, it's Marshall McLuhan, really.
The book that made him famous was the *Gutenberg Galaxy*, which was published back in the 1960s, where he basically made
the case that the beginning of the electric age
was the end of the print era. So it was really quite a long time ago. The advent of radio and TV brought the gradual return of
orality, what Walter Ong calls a secondary orality, back into culture.
McLuhan thought would come with a return of some of the consciousness attributes of an oral culture:

- A more mythic approach to reality.
- More heightened emotionality, more,
- More tribalism.

If you look at how the counterculture erupted, and the way our world has
developed since the two world wars, you think, "Maybe he was onto something."
But further, I believe that the revolution happened gradually, and then all at once with the internet.
The Internet, in a sense, that crystallized something which had been latent
in broadcast media, perhaps because broadcast media are broadcast. There's only so far the picture can fragment, as long
there are still these structural forces: the gatekeepers, who has control of the microphone, which is basically more or less
the situation you have with TV, even as channels proliferate.

But then the internet comes along, and all of that is suddenly very much up for grabs.
Everybody's curating their own personal feed of whatever it is that they want, and the race to the
bottom feels as though it's been very, very sudden, and a lot of people are still reeling slightly with shock, thinking,
"Well, what just happened?"

Gene Callahan: So, some people might push back on the idea that something novel is going on.
They might say, "You know, the phone, the smartphone, it's just a new tool."

People like David Chalmers have put out the extended mind hypothesis, that our minds actually reside not just in our brains, but in our tools, in our books,
and so on.  You know, a shovel is a part of our mind because it's shaped so that we can dig with it properly, and once you learn to use it.
Michael Polanyi, talks about how the blind man's stick becomes an extension of the blind man's arm, and he actually feel
the world with the tip of the stick.

So someone might say, "Well, these phones, they're just another element of extended mind, and we've been doing this with technology since we began chipping rocks.
Nothing to see here."

Mary Harrington: Well, I think that's true, it's not a rebuttal. In a sense, it doesn't really do anything except put
forward the same thesis, but from a different angle, and say it's fine, actually. And let me be clear: I'm not saying
that any of this is necessarily bad. I think it comes with some downsides that
people who like the modern world have perhaps not appreciated.
But it also comes with some significant upsides.

The entry into modernity was not cost-free, right?
The world is full of people shroud-waving about disenchantment and the like.
Or moaning about the atomizing and ecocidal impact of industrial technologies, or what have you. You know, all of these
not so desirable byproducts of modernity, which we tend to kind of look past because we quite like the washing machines.
I mean, you'll prise my washing machine from my cold, dead hands, no matter how mournfully I wring my hands about.
modernity, or water tables, or pollution, or whatever.

So, there's a sort of double-think that I think even vociferous technology critics are actually sort of tacitly quite
comfortable with.

But, what I think we can still be attentive to... and again, here, I'm mostly just channeling
Marshall McLuhan. I think you can... without saying that the effect of a particular extension
is good or bad, we can explore what it does and how it extends our
abilities, and whether there are other abilities that we might lose as a trade-off for extending those capacities.

Just as creatures that live underground develop acutely sensitized
hearing, for example, but aren't particularly good at seeing things, because they just don't need to.
You hyper-attune the senses that you're focused into, and perhaps allow the other ones to
atrophy somewhat. And just saying let's be attentive to what is atrophying, is not the same
as saying, "Oh, this is bad and we must return to some past state,"
because that's just not going to happen, right?

I think it's perfectly legitimate to be curious, about what we run the risk of
atrophying in the course of developing a new extension, and perhaps to suggest, politely, that it might be worth being
a little bit intentional about how, or how quickly, or to what extent, we allow
faculties to atrophy. Just to concretize this a little bit more, one of the books I've
been really enjoying reading, lately, in the context of thinking about how consciousness shifted
with the advent of the printing press, is Mary Carruthers. I don't know if she's still alive now, but she wrote a book
in the late-20th century on the art of memory, which is to say, medieval nemotechnics.

That is a whole series of practices for remembering stuff from an age when books were just incredibly rare, and you
might, for instance, get one go at the codex, and then it goes back in the cupboard, and that's it, and then you have to go
home and you never see it again.
You can't take photocopies, there isn't spare paper to write stuff down, you just have to remember it. And people were
amazingly good at this. And this is a set of techniques which, you know, apart from sort of card trick guys, and, you
know, fairground entertainers, and just nerds who like to show off, and just eccentric people, it's almost completely
neglected as a set of cognitive tools, but it's incredibly effective. And this was just completely standard practice for
well-educated medievals.

They would literally construct their memory, and they had all these very vivid metaphors for what they were doing. They
would describe it as a series of pigeonholes, or the cells in a honeycomb, or a treasure box. All these these metaphors
for containers of precious things. What they were doing was a very methodical kind of inward filing. And
these are practices that we just don't have anymore, because we don't need them.

And you you can say, "Well, so what? Now we just have Google, or whatever." But
you can also be attentive to what changes.

When a set of techniques like that are lost, and with it came the atrophying of medieval mnemotechnics.
But with the atrophying of that as a set of necessary skills, which
every educated person needed to learn, they also lost an entire method of
composing arguments and an entire visual vocabulary for illustrating arguments,
and whole panoply of other shared cultural reference points, all of which
together makes up a huge portion of the cultural color of medieval thought.

And the simple fact that we just don't learn that stuff anymore is -- and I'm quoting
C.S. Lewis here -- it's one of the biggest barriers between them and us. It's what makes
the medieval so completely opaque. I think it's a major contributor to why so many otherwise extremely literate thinkers
seem to just go straight from, say, Plato to Descartes, and just skip the entire Middle Ages.

Gene Callahan: As if it just isn't there.

Mary Harrington: There's a slightly more complex set of reasons for it as well, but I think a significant chunk
of it is just down to the fact of not understanding how the medievals thought, because we don't understand how rhetoric
and the art of memory works. This means that basically the subtleties of medieval thought are unintelligible to us,
to a far more radical degree than people realize.

So to bring this fairly extended analogy back to the question of phones and, "You know, isn't this just an extension of ourselves?"
Absolutely, that's completely true. However, I bring up the medieval art of memory, as a quite precise analogy
for the kind of thing we need to be attentive to when we think about how something like a smartphone, for
example, or the use of ChatGPT changes our relationship to our ideas. And it changes how we retain ideas, and what ideas
we retain, and how we structure our approach to thinking. I think if it's possible for the loss of something like the
art of memory to create so fundamental a cultural gulf between different eras.

Then it stands to reason that an equivalent shift in our relationship to our storage and retrieval of ideas could very well have
an equivalently transformative effect, which could be good, or it could just sever the world that is from the world that
will be. And I think it's worth being thoughtful about how we approach that.
If that's a future that we want to walk into, I propose that we should do it with our eyes as open as
possible, and not just as the kids say, YOLO it.

Gene Callahan: I teach software engineering, and
one thing I've noticed is that when something goes wrong with the program one of my students is working on,
it's important to focus on the error message and contemplate it and think about what this could be caused by.
And it's extremely hard for me to get my students to simply leave one screen alone,
static on the monitor. They want to continually swipe from screen to screen.
This makes it impossible to even carefully read the error message that they're getting.

So, there's a very mundane example, but it really is striking how
little tolerance they have for having one still thing in front of them on the computer.

Mary Harrington: Yes, there were some figures that popped up recently in the press about something
like 1 in 3 kids that start school in the United Kingdom simply doesn't know how to interact with a
book. They try to zoom it or swipe it as though it's an iPad. Which, maybe your guy might say, "Well, so what?"

Gene Callahan: Well, for one thing, they can't debug the programs if they're doing that swiping.

Mary Harrington: Yes. There's pretty persuasive evidence -- I think the citation for this would be Nicholas Carr, who
wrote *The Shallows* back in the aughts -- 
where he cites a whole panoply of evidence to the effect that reading on a printed page is different in kind
from reading in that associative way that you do across multiple Web pages, both in terms of the kind of thinking
that you do, and the amount which is retained.
For example, in the course of reading a long-form argument in a printed book, thoughtfully over a period of time, you'll
have a dialogue, and not just with the author, but also in your own mind, once you read
competently enough to be able to read swiftly. You'll find yourself reading, I'm sure you have this experience all the
time. You're not just reading, but in the back of your mind, you're cross-referencing, or you're arguing back,
so you're dialoguing with the text, but in a sense, your stored memory, your own memory palace, because we all
have one to an extent.

And again, I'm not violently anti-tech. For instance, one of the more interesting practices that I've noticed emerges
amongst people who like to read and who are also somewhat online, is I'll find myself absorbed in a book.  But I also
have in my mind 4 or 5 interlocutors who are interested in similar subjects, and occasionally I'll think of somebody,
and I'll photograph the page and text it to them.

And that creates a whole secondary or tertiary dialogue, which really does feel like an extension of that
expert reader dialogue, which people like Marianne Wolff and Nicholas Carr talk about. It feels like an externalization
of that, which is mediated through the phone or the chat window.

So it's not to say that these things are mutually exclusive, it's absolutely not. It's more about... it's more a
question of intentionality and not confusing one thing for the other.

Returning to our theme of translating ideas between media, *The Lord of the Rings* is a great series of movies. It's also a
fantastic set of books. It's the same story, by and large, but nobody would go through it
in both forms and say there's no difference between them, right?

And I think that's very much the subject that we're talking about here, a translation between between information
technologies. It seems logical to me that we should be able to apply the same level of critical reflection to what's
happening in that sense, and in this field, and not make it either into some sort of dumb culture war thing, or a sort
of tech doomerism, or indeed a sort of rushing into the future without any care or attentiveness to the treasures that
we already have.

Gene Callahan: To your point, I find, in my writing and editing, I always finish on paper.
My last couple of edits, at some point, I have to get off the screen to really read the piece.

Mary Harrington: Yes, I don't do that for short pieces anymore. But I think that's more a function of time than anything
else, but the last few times I've written anything long form, absolutely. And certainly, when it comes down to proofing
a book, there's no other way around it. You sit down with a red pen and a ruler, there's no other way.

Gene Callahan: Man, I've been missing the ruler! No wonder...

In any case, if liberal democracy was the political form appropriate to the age of print.
what political form is going to be appropriate for our post-literary age?

Mary Harrington: I don't know, and I'm hesitant to... to be too concrete, because I think this is the sort of thing
which can... which can land quite differently according to local cultural conditions, but it seems plausible to me that
a genuinely post-liberal politics will be more autocratic in some form, or other.

And I think you could... you can probably make the case. Several foreign policy publications have
recently, in fact, made the case that that's actually already happening. It doesn't take me being a
a prophet of doom to note that the world seems recently to have been carved up between three
three very post-liberal-seeming, sphere of influence guys.
Not one of which is based in the United Kingdom. But, this is the considered and not particularly delighted view of
serious people in the foreign policy world, that something very much more imperious and imperial is already upon us.
I think the nation-state has had it, but I also think we already knew that.

It's only normal voters who still think we have nation-states, or have been acting as if we still have
nation-states since the Second World War. The guys who are in a position to actually decide anything have been
acting, for a very long time, as if that needs to be bypassed. And I think that all happened with the best of
intentions: this isn't some sort of sinister plot, lest you be tempted to depict me as a tinfoil hatter, I'm not.

This is, with the best will in the world, there are a lot of people who have been very worried that if
we ended up with nation-states again, then they'd end up with national wars again, and then millions
more would have to die like they did in the First and Second World Wars.

Yeah, nobody, nobody wants that. So, you know, let's have... let's have something transnational and post-national
instead, and we'll have international, universal systems of governance, and it'll all be much more cooperative and
collaborative and sensible and rational, and we won't
do any more fighting. That was the hope.

So we've got this sort of strange kind of pantomime, a strange sort of chimeric, political order, where
about half of the people in charge want it to be transnational or postnational, and the other half are determined
that it shouldn't be, so nobody can really get anything done.

But I think, sometimes when I'm in my grumpier moods, "Well, you know, maybe the post-nationals are sort of directionally right."

And here I come back again to my rather sort of Marshall McLuhan-ish speculations about the end of the print era:
the printing press and the nation-state are coextensive in terms of their emergence. did a
hopeless job of summarizing all of the ways in which print changed the world, but one of the ways print changed the
world was helping to create the nation-state as a political form.

For one thing, it helped to kill off Latin as a lingua franca.
It consolidates these , which hadn't really existed before, based on people's reading in a vernacular.
And it's only once you have that, that larger reading public, that you can begin to create what Benedict Anderson calls
the imagined community, which is an enabling condition for the nation-state as a political form.

When you run that scenario in reverse... well, I don't really like any of the outcomes of that.
What does it look like if the nation-state comes apart into its national components. And here I mean "nations"
in the Old Testament sense.

It's obviously historically the case that nation and state haven't always coincided. In fact,
there's something peculiarly modern about that. Do we get something like the Habsburg Empire,
a state comprising multiple nations?

I don't really want to think about it in very much detail, because there's no plausible scenario which isn't quite ugly,
at least, until everything settles down again.

I forget who, but it was "someone on the Internet," that pointed out, I think, persuasively, that once you have constant
transnational connectivity that the idea of migrants integrating is fundamentally a non-starter. 

Whereas, for example, when people left to go and settle in Australia, and moved halfway around the world 100 or 200 years ago, they basically said goodbye to their family, and they might never see them again. So they have to fit in wherever it is that they find themselves.
But when you can just be constantly messaging to whoever it is that you're still friends with back home, you just don't really need to be where you are at all.
Except maybe in a sort of very thin economic sense.
Or perhaps a, perhaps a sort of equally thinly sort of administrative one.
But in terms of the kind of presence which is denoted by actual integration, you sort of don't really need to. You you might want to, but you don't have to.


Gene Callahan: Neil Stephenson, in *The Diamond Age*, depicts what he calls phyles, or geographically dispersed polities
scattered across a globe from which nation-states have disappeared. Your phyle is similar to a guild you belong to, and
they'll step in and defend you against aggression by people from other phyles.
It's an interesting speculation on what might be coming.

Mary Harrington: It's an interesting speculation, although, I'd probably want to set that against the IR maxim that geography is destiny.
This is an idea that's been kicked around more recently in the tech communities, hasn't it, in the form of network
states? And the question which I have yet to see answered, at least openly, I'm sure they talk about it privately
amongst themselves, is what hard power looks like in a network state.
Who manufactures the weapons? Who defends the supply lines? Who's making the food?
And if you're just gonna wave your arms and say, "Oh, it's all robots," my response is "Okay, who's guarding the power stations? And with what?"

Because the question, you and whose army is bound to emerge sooner or later. At least if you have a fairly tragic view
of human nature, you're expecting it to emerge sooner or later, right?

Gene Callahan: That's right.


Mary Harrington: To complete that thought about dispersed communities interacting all the way around the world.
When we think about nations and states coming apart, I think the most depressing version of that scenario is ethnic
balkanization within what were previously more homogenous nation-states. There's some sort of thin, supranational
governance, and then splits along very much more tribalized line below that.

There are doomsayers who warn that that's already happening in some European countries. For example, people talk about
no-go zones in some Swedish cities.
Now, we have to take such reports with a pinch of salt, because whoever it is who produces a report like that has always
got an axe to grind. Nevertheless, there does seem to be a sort of re-tribalization occurring.
And this is happening even within polities that had explicitly embraced a version of modernity, which disavowed
tribalism as being a thing of the past. I don't think it's a thing of the past, or at least if it *was* a thing of the past,
I have a horrible feeling it will be a thing of the future as well. I don't love that outcome. I don't love that story,
but I think that's part of what nation-states coming apart looks like.

So, you can paint a gloomy picture about the end of liberal democracy, but I think, the more alarming side of that story
is retribalization.

Gene Callahan: OK, can you give us a sneak preview of your new book?

Mary Harrington: Well, this is what we've been talking about: it's the whole thing. The title is *The King and
the Swan*, and the one-liner is *Politics After the Singularity*, my thesis being that the singularity already
happened, and in fact, it was just the point where the smartphone became pervasive.

But this isn't the *first* singularity. We merged with our information technologies before: the printing press.
And even that wasn't the first singularity, because before that, we merged with our information technologies when we
invented the Greek alphabet.

And so I'm tracing the development, particularly of European/Western
cultures, from the inception of the alphabet through these two earlier singularities of the invention of literacy, and
then the invention of the printing press, and then setting some of the developments of the digital age in the context of
those developments to tease out some of the pros and cons.

Gene Callahan: Is there a reason you're focusing on the Greek alphabet? After all, 
the Phoenicians had an alphabet, and the Hebrews adopted that, prior to the Greek alphabet.

Mary Harrington: The Phoenician one was the one that turned into the Greek alphabet. The significance of the Greek
alphabet was that that was the point where all the sounds had their own symbols.
Yes, the Jewish people had had a script for considerably longer than that.
The Jewish history of scriptural study and deep literacy is thousands of years old. I'm certainly not ignoring that.
But the significance of the Greek alphabet is that it represents all of the sounds, whereas earlier scripts only had the
consonants.

Gene Callahan: Okay, that's what I was curious about.

You have made a point about the European states
attempting to show that they are ready to stand up to Trump over Greenland and stand up to Russia.

And, you posted a picture of the be-cardiganed NATO guy talking tough like this.
I looked at the picture, and I thought, "Well, if I wanted to say what threat this guy would represent, I'd say he's
perhaps a threat to maybe steal your organic bran muffins, and not much worse. And certainly not to fight Russia.

So, I think your view that the states in Western Europe are American protectorates is accurate. It's
perhaps what the Trump administration is trying to, to break that dependency.

Mary Harrington: I think anyone from another planet who counted the number of American military bases in Europe
would conclude that Europe is American occupied territory.

Gene Callahan: No doubt.

Mary Harrington: Of course, the relationship is far more complex than that.

You know, some of my best friends are American, etc., etc.

Gene Callahan: Hey, some of the Greeks' best friends were Romans, even when Greece was a part of the Roman Empire!

Mary Harrington: The relationship is complicated, think it's basically accurate that the European states are American protectorates...
and there's a great deal of ambivalence about that.

It's not really clear to me how all of that is going to shake down. A lot of it depends on who comes after Trump, doesn't it?

Of course, you've got three more years of him, and, based on how it's gone so far, pretty much anything could happen over that time.

Gene Callahan: Certainly.

Mary Harrington: But nobody really knows who or what comes next.

Gene Callahan: Now, an interesting point on this topic is that being inside an empire is a mixed bag.
If you look at the Roman Empire, the invading Germans were not invading for the most part because they wanted to
defeat the empire, they were invading because they wanted to live inside it.

Mary Harrington: That's right.

Gene Callahan: You wrote about Helen Andrews' essay on the feminization of work.
And you feel she missed some points there. Could you describe what her essay overlooks?

Mary Harrington: Well, when I wrote *Feminism Against Progress*, it was about the emergence of the women's movement, and
it touched on some of the same themes that Helen hits in that essay,
particularly, a very strong female representation in certain kinds of knowledge work.
This has happened especially in the kinds of moral, disciplinary, educational, and moral conditioning-type work that
used to be done by church ladies in the nineteenth century.

And now in the 20th and 21st centuries, it's done by HR ladies, who are functionally the same, and they're the same class and type of person as the church
ladies. Just they now do that job for money now instead of for free.

I think it's just a mistake to attribute the "great feminization" entirely to women, because I think some of it is
a product of our environment. And I don't just mean this in a sense of 
Helen's argument, where all we have to do in terms of the environment is take our thumb off the scales and civilization will correct itself.
Which may be, but I just think it's a mistake to attribute feminization, as she characterizes it, purely to women.
Which sounds like a crazy argument to make!

But let me give you an example: one of the most commonly cited sexed differences, on average, is between male and female
typical styles of conflict.
Men are more physically violent than women. Men tend to form in-groups and compete with other in-groups.
in social forms which have a clear hierarchy.

Women tend to have more flat, diffuse social structures, and to conduct
their interpersonal conflicts indirectly through social means, such as ostracism, or dogpiling, or what have you.

But if you've ever watched a group of young, predominantly, or perhaps exclusively male, right-winger norms,
having an argument on the Internet, you'll see that the "feminine-style" is the mode of conflict there.

If you think about what the Internet does as a form, what it does is it incentivizes
endless talking, ostracism, backbiting, dogpiling, and so on, and it forecloses actual physical violence.
So, as a form, it forces everybody into a social performance which is indistinguishable from
what Joyce Bennison characterizes as feminization.

So, the Internet is actually feminizing everybody. Social media is an incredibly feminizing technology.
Of course, the Internet is a long way from being the only phenomenon which contributes to this kind of subtle,
pervasive social shift. Just think about the transition of work away from arduous manual labor of the kind
that privileges men towards the more flat-structured, socially-based skills, promoting, managerial-type work, which very
much more advantages women.

So is it all down to some malign attribute of women that people are tending more to exhibit feminine styles of behaviour?
I'm not convinced. Certainly, you can cite statistics until you're blue in the face about the
about the increased presence of women in the workforce, but most of the trends which
are decried under the heading of feminization and blamed on women started long before the women were in the workforce in
any numbers at all.

So I think there's a really important factor that needs to be taken into account,
which is the overall sociocultural effects of our prevailing material environment, and the social forms that it
produces, which Helen's essay leaves out.

And if you ignore that, you get a large-scale hand-waving, all of which just cashes out as we need to kick women out of the workforce.
But to me, that just seems stupid, and fundamentally mistaken. I guess I would say that, wouldn't I?

Look, I don't particularly love cancel culture, right?
But I don't think it would go away if you remove women from the workforce, I really don't.
Not unless you also changed, fundamentally, a number of other salient features of the prevailing culture.

Gene Callahan: OK, let's end off on a gloomy note.

Mary Harrington: Huh. Do we have to? Yes, I guess we do.

Gene Callahan: In *Feminism Against Progress*, as I recall, one of the major themes is that
market dominance of the economy works towards making people interchangeable.
"The market" wants to flatten any differences between men and women, because it wants them as cogs in the machine of
production.

And I was just reading a paper on Hannah Arendt, quoting her saying that
one of the characteristics of totalitarianism is that it wants to flatten all differences and make people as
interchangeable as possible.

And this raises the specter, a specter of what, for my libertarian friends, would be impossible, that of totalitarian capitalism.

One where everyone has been reduced to a cog in a great machine of production, except for the the few people on top, running it.

Do you see that as a possible outcome of what is occurring around us now?

Mary Harrington: I don't know, I mean, I think the most likely countervailing force against an outcome like that is
probably one which would be, in effect, just as depressing, which is to say the oncoming tidal wave of demographic and
cognitive collapse.

I'm not sure which version of catastrophe we're going to get first... maybe we'll get both at once?
On the one hand, we seem to on a trajectory towards what you characterize as totalitarian
capitalism, but then, also, populations are imploding to as-yet-unknown effect.

Furthermore, the cognitive transformations affected by post-literacy are also driving a rapid decline in people's
ability to think rationally. Which, if you think about it for even a moment, you'll agree it's just visible
everywhere. And this is driving a competence crisis across all of the technical and engineering skills that we
need to just keep everything that we already have functioning, let alone, I don't know, to make it into space or whatever.

With potholes appearing in the roads, and and electricity substations spontaneously catching fire,
and windows falling out of airplanes, and air traffic control systems going kaput every 5 or 10 minutes,
I'm not sure how long that's compatible with the sort of
dark, dystopian, or hyper-efficient image of totalitarian capitalism.

Gene Callahan: Maybe more like in the movie *Brazil*?

Mary Harrington: Yes, a nightmare future where you somehow get both of those feels like, it
might be sustainable for a bit, but eventually, eventually the sheer force of numptiness is gonna sink your
Gattaca dystopia, right? Just because people can't keep the lights on.

So, it's not a particularly cheery argument, my stance of
skepticism towards totalitarian capitalism. But I just think people are too human
to allow that to happen. It won't happen, because people will just be like, "Oh, I can't be
bothered," or they'll forget to turn the gas off, or something like that.
It's never going to get that efficient. I just don't buy it.

Gene Callahan: Well, I think, what we have to do is, when this is published, is to send all the readers a bottle of
antidepressants to take while they read this.

Mary Harrington: Just to put slightly more positive gloss.
on what I just said. Well, actually, now that I think about it, I realize it *isn't* a more positive gloss.
So, just to wrap things up on an even more miserable note, there are times when I
look at the fertility crisis, and I think, "That's nature taking its course."
That's nature self-correcting. This is a culture which is obviously so comprehensively,
organismically intolerable, that people have just stopped having kids in it.
And it will therefore, eventually, over several generations, it will self-correct.

And something will come out which won't be either version of the dystopia which I just
painted. And I think it'll probably be a bumpy ride getting there, but I think we will get there, and we'll remain
human, whether we want to or not.

Gene Callahan: OK, this has been very interesting, but I don't want to take up any more of your time, for which I thank you.

Mary Harrington: No, it's great to speak to you, Eugene.
