# Interview with Musa al-Gharbi


* Start with a summary.
    You and I know what your thesis is... Or at least, you do, and I hope I do.
    But since for many of the readers of Modern
    Age, this may serve as an introduction to your book, let's begin with a brief statement of your arguments.


* You look at four great awokenings. It strikes me that it might be worthwhile to go back further, and compare these
    with the religious awakenings in the 19th century, any indeed with earlier millennialist and apocalyptic
    movements, which have been popping up regularly since the age of ecumenic conquests in the last centuries BC.


* You characterize the First Awokening as the most intense... can you offer our readers
    some examples of how that was so?


* Certainly people sometimes believe things because it is in their self interest to do so, but I get an uneasy feeling
    as more things that start to be explained that way.  Did Marx *really* believe in scientific materialism, or was it
    just in his class interest to say he did?  Socrates?  Was it in your class interest to write this book?


* "Racialized inequalities": What about Asians? 11% of professors but 6% of the population.


* Let's consider Gregory Clark's thesis: elite status lingers for generations.


* Isn't spelling Black with a B the kind of empty gesture you are discussing?


* Are elites "sincere" in their wokeness? My "sincere" commitment to sobriety. Put your money where your mouth is.


* al-Gharbi also periodically uses the slur terms "homophobe" and "transphobe." These are not serious elements of social
    analysis, and do not belong in a book of this quality. We can find objections to homosexuality in the words of Buddha,
    Plato, St. Paul, Mohammed, Aquinas, and many other serious thinkers: it is absurd to chalk these cases up to a common
    phobia they all had. What's more, the people who use these terms do not actually treat their targets as having a
    phobia: We do not morally condemn claustrophobics, but the people who use 'homophobic' and 'transphobic' certainly do
    mean to condemn those they label. These terms are attempts to have one's cake and eat it too: We do not need to
    seriously consider any of the aforementioned thinkers opinions on homosexuality: no, they were suffering from a
    phobia. But at the same time we can still morally condemn them, because somehow this phobia is not a mental affliction
    they suffer from but a deliberate choice on their part.


* Is it utopian to expect a society with no heirarchy?
    (My truism: The attempt to create a society, with no hierarchy, just result in a vicious struggle for position by
    destabilizing existing hierarchy.)


* Should people feel guilty about using DoorDash, Uber, and Lyft? If the people working those gig jobs had a better
    alternative, when they be doing that already?


* You claim the "wealth" of Uber etc. is "derived" from the workers... but doesn't the software also account for a
portion of that wealth? (I favor trying to set up worker-owned work sharing apps.)

* Can universities really "set rents" at whatever level they want?


* Rene Girard's analysis of scapegoating.


* Voegelin: we are cast into the mystery of existence. Ideologies are easy answers.

Black and Hispanic "formally qualified engineers"





## A story

some unfortunate manager asked a couple of black cooks to come up with a lunch for African-American history month. And
what they served was something like fried chicken, collard greens, black-eyed peas, and Kool-Aid. Now I regularly play
music in black churches in South Carolina, and except for the Kool-Aid (it would be sweet tea) this meal would be a big
hit at any of them. In fact, it would be a big hit with most white people down here as well.

And, in fact, it's a meal that would be eaten much more often by black Americans then what is served on St. Patrick's
Day is eaten by Irish Americans: my family, a corn, beef and cabbage exactly once per year, on St. Patrick's Day. And we
never drank green beer.

But a black student at our school complained, and the university pressured the catering company to fire somebody. It
wouldn't do to fire the black fellows who designed the menu, so they just went up the chain until they found a white
person, and fired him.

What is interesting to know here is that the person fired was a working class guy probably struggling to make ends meet
doing food service, while the complainant, being a student at a prestigious, engineering school, is destined for high
career earnings.
