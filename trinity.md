# A Meditation on the Algorithm as an Image for the Trinity

The idea of the Trinity, while central to Christianity, has proven a tough
pill for non-Christians to swallow. To Jewish and Muslim monotheists, it often
seems a re-admission of pagan polytheism into polite, Abrahamic society.
On the other hand, to many sceptics, it simply says something ridiculous 
like 1 = 3. Nevertheless, as prominent a philosopher as R.G. Collingwood,
in *An Essay on Metaphysics*, contended that the doctrine of the Trinity was 
the philosophical solution to the metaphysical crisis that was destroying the
pagan world, and pagan science along with it,and that this doctrine "has been the main
or fundamental presuppositions of natural science ever since" (1984: ???).

Therefore, it may be worthwhile to seek out metaphors that can render this symbol
more comprehensible to those not inclined to accept it as an article of faith.
The English novelist, translator, and theologian Dorothy Sayers found art
offered an illuminating image of the Trinity. She devoted an entire book
to that topic (*The Mind of the Maker*), so a short excerpt cannot do her work justice,
but can give us a flavor of what she was up to:

"For every work [or act] of creation is threefold, an earthly trinity to match
the heavenly.

"First, [not in time, but merely in order of enumeration] there is the Creative
Idea, passionless, timeless, beholding the whole work complete at once, the end
in the beginning: and this is the image of the Father.

"Second: there is the Creative Energy [or Activity] begotten of that idea,
working in time from the beginning to the end, with sweat and passion, being
incarnate in the bonds of matter: and this is the image of the Word.

"Third: there is the Creative Power, the meaning of the work and its response
in the lively soul: and this is the image of the indwelling Spirit.

"And these three are one, each equally in itself the whole work, whereof none
can exist without other: and this is the image of the Trinity." (2004: 28)


I was struck by the possibility of using the concept of the algorithm,
in a fashion similar to how Sayers had used art, while lecturing on computer
science.
As I taught my students the Sieve of Eratosthenes (an algorithm to identify prime
numbers, first described by Eratosthenes in the third century BC).
I described the sieve
verbally, then I had them "run" the sieve on paper, then program it in Visual
Basic.

Each step in my lecture: the verbal description, the paper-based version,
and the coded Visual Basic version, are an "implementation" of the algorithm.
And there are infinitely many more possible implementations, in all
existing programming languages, as well as in all possible programming languages
not yet devised. That led me to ask,"What is the Sieve of Eratosthenes **itself**,
apart from its implementations?"

This of course is but one more version of the problem that Plato and Aristotle
grappled with, on the relation of the forms to their particulars. Plato's
approach was to regard a particular instance of a form
as inferior "copy" of that form. That understanding
tended to lead to a contempt for the world of particulars, and Gnostic ideas
like the creation of the sensible world by an evil demiurge. On the other hand,
Aristotle emphasized the particular, leading him to posit a God who was so
totally removed from the world that He did not even know it existed.

The problem, it seemed to me as I contemplated this matter, is that each view
is one-sided, and treats the algorithm and its implementations as though they
could be pulled apart. But the implementations are meaningless except as
implementations of the form. We might understand this by saying that the
"algorithm itself" is the generative source of the implementations. But it is
not something different from those implementations, nor did it stamp them out,
as though on an assembly line. We might say the implementations of the form are
one in being with the form, and that they are begotten, not made by it.

Furthermore, we finite beings are only able to perceive the form itself through
its implementations. There is simply no way to convey to anyone else what the
generative form of the algorithm is without pointing them to the form fleshed
out in some implementation or another, or, we might say, as humans, our only
path to the generative source is through the source made flesh.

But we might further notice that we haven't completed our analysis of this
matter just yet: neither the generative form nor its implementation are
complete without the actual running of the algorithm, until we give it life by
executing it, on paper, or in our head, or on a computer. The generative form
is made fully real through its implementations by the power of executing it.
But that power is also one in being with the form and the implementations: we
might say the execution of an algorithm *proceeds* from its generative form and
its implementation.

## Conclusion

The fact that the fairly modern idea of "an algorithm" -- the ancient Greeks 
had devised a number of algorithms, such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes previously
mentioned, or "Euclid's Algorithm" for calculating greatest common divisors, 
but they had not formulated the notion of an algorithm itself -- displays all
of the aspects of the symbol of the Trinity might give sceptics pause to 
consider whether they have unduly dismissed an concept that, as Collingwood
saw it, was a significant metaphysical breakthrough.

It should not surprise as that, as human life proceeds in its history,
it might offer up entirely new ways to understand eternal verities. The logos
is complete in eternity, but unfolds gradually in time through
the action of the Holy Spirit.
