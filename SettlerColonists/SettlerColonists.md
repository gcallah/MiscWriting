# Who's a Settler Colonialist Now?

There has been a lot of attention paid of late to exactly who are indigenous
people in some area, and who are not. The people who came after the
indigenous people are often referred to as engaged in "settler
colonialism."

But why should we care about who qualifies as "indigenous" in some place
and who doesn't? Well, the basic idea is that the indigenous people were
there first, and some other group came along later, and pushed them
aside. In recognition for having suffered an historical injustice, the
indigenous people are entitled to certain rights and protections, or so
the prevalent theory goes.

So, then, who is indigenous? My Merriam-Webster dictionary has the
following definition: "indigenous: of or relating to the earliest known
inhabitants of a place..."

This is a simple, fairly straightforward definition to apply. Of course,
given new archaeological evidence, we might find that some previously
unknown inhabitants had been in some locale before the people who up
till then had been thought to be the indigenous population. But we would
not expect that to happen very often. So it should be fairly easy to
decide just who is indigenous, and who a settler colonist, right?

However, I was recently at a lecture on
Austronesian culture. The lecturer mentioned that the Philippines were first
settled 47,000 years ago. The Austronesians arrived on the islands 4000
years ago and almost completely displaced the people who had been there.
(The original inhabitants left their trace in the "Negritos" of the
islands, who, nevertheless, have mixed with Austronesians and speak
Austronesian languages.) Yet several times later in the lecture she
referred to the artifacts produced by the Austronesians as "indigenous"
Filipino culture.

This is curious: weren't the ancestors of the Negritos the indigenous
people of the Phillipines? And doesn't the Austronesian takeover of the
archipelago fit the "settler colonialism" concept to a T? After all, the
Austronesians wiped out the indigenous culture so thoroughly that not
one of the indigenous languages survives.

In Southern Africa, as Wikipedia notes, "\[Southwards moving Bantu
people\] displaced, conquered, and absorbed the original \[i.e.,
indigenous\] Khoisan, Khoikhoi and San peoples." Dutch settlers often
allied with the indigenous people resisting Bantu incursions.
Nevertheless, several paragraphs later, Wikipedia describes the people
living in South Africa as the Dutch, the English, and the indigenous
people... despite the fact that many of the people lumped into the
indigenous category were recent invaders attempting to subjugate the
people who were actually indigenous by the Merriam-Webster definition!

Celtic people (including my ancestors) only arrived in Ireland in
roughly the third millenniumÂ BC, largely displacing the culture of the
existing inhabitants of the island, which had been settled several
thousand years earlier. Again, the Celts would appear to be, by any
neutral definition, classic "settler colonialists." But bizarrely, a
group of people that only split off from mainstream Irish culture in
about 1600, the Travellers, are now deemed "indigenous." (See
https://public-history-weekly.degruyter.com/10-2022-2/unsilencing-indigenous-ireland/)
Their claim to being indigenous seems to mostly rest on the fact that
the rest of the Irish population, whose ancestors generally arrived at
just the same time as those of the Travellers, don't particularly fancy
them.

All of the languages of northern India are languages of invading
Indo-Europeans, who migrated to an area that had already given birth to
the Indus Valley civilization. The subcontinent was then invaded again
by nomadic Muslims. The British were the third main invading culture to
dominate India. But in another weird twist, the Muslim people of Kashmir
are now being termed "indigenous," while Hindus are being accused of
settler colonialism in the area. (See
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/dech.12809.)

The arbitrariness of many of the uses of "indigenous" and "settler
colonialism" demonstrates that these terms are not being employed in any
objective or impartial manner. (Indeed, my suggestion that they ought to
be used impartially will probably be accused of forwarding the settler
colonialist concept of "impartiality.") Instead of being founded in
serious intellectual analysis of the situations under consideration,
they are instead pieces of partisan propaganda: in some conflict, just
designate the side you favor as "indigenous," and the side you don't
like as "settler colonialist," and... you win! And, in fact, the UN has
formally declared its adherence to this sort of arbitrary standard:
"There is no singularly authoritative definition of indigenous
peoples... In fact... articles 9 and 33 state that indigenous peoples
and individuals have the right to belong to an indigenous community or
nation, in accordance with the traditions and customs of the community
or nation concerned, and that they have the right to determine their own
identity." So, per the UN, being "indigenous" is simply a matter of
identifying oneself as indigenous... and now you have extra rights your
fellow citizens lack. I think I might self-identify as an indigenous
resident of South Carolina, and see if I can get some discounts at
Piggly Wiggly, or a few free tickets to a Clemson football game.

The importance tied to the issue of just who is indigenous, and who is a
settler colonialist, has been raised to even greater prominence by the
current conflict in Gaza, where both sides try to contend they are "more
indigenous" than the other. That such a question could possibly have any
definitive answer in a region like the Middle East, the history of which
has been characterized by thousands and thousands of years of conquests
and migrations, is ridiculous: both the Israelis and the Palestinians in
the area most likely have some ancestors who were in the area millenia
ago, and some ancestors who were more recent invaders of the land. To
invoke "settler colonialism" in this conflict is an attempt to avoid
serious consideration of what a just resolution of the present dispute
might entail, and instead play the "I'm more indigenous than you" card
as a trump.

The paths of men are twisted, and any attempt to draw a simple morality
play out of that tangle must do violence to historical reality. Every
single one of us has ancestors who did something terrible to some other
people, as well as ancestors who were victims of something terrible
having been done to them. How could we possibly apportion guilt amongst
the earth's present population based on what their ancestors were up to,
when every single family tree will contain innumerable oppressors and
oppressed? However much we might wish to undo all settler colonialism,
we can't possibly put everyone back where they "came from," or all eight
billion of us will have to crowd into East Africa. We can't restore all
lands to their original inhabitants: who will get, for instance, the
Philippines? Should we assign ownership based upon what percentage of
Negrito DNA each person has?

We cannot make the past more just than it was: it lies beyond our reach.
It is only the future that we can make more just. And I suggest that
trying to assign blame to living people for things done by their remote
ancestors is a barrier, rather than a step, towards doing so.
