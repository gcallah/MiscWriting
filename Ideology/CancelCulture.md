# Has cancel culture been canceled?


Marko Elez, a software engineer working in Elon Musk's DOGE, was recently "canceled" due to some offensive remarks...
and then uncanceled the next day.

Elez had posted some very obnoxious things, such as "Normalize Indian hate," and "Just for the record, I was racist before it
was cool."

But Musk has said he will hire Elez back, remarking "To err is human, to forgive divine."

Was this a sign that "cancel culture" is over?

Meanwhile, Danielle Salinas, a medical assistant at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, was called out by Andy
Ngo for posts approving violence against government officials she does not like, which apparently means pretty much
anyone to the right of her.

Are the people who attacked "cancel culture" hypocritical to call out Salinas for her statements?
One commenter on Ngo's post said, "Cancel culture is alive and well I guess."

To answer these questions, first let us take a look at just what people were objecting to when they complained about
about cancel culture.

The justified complaints about cancel culture have arisen in cases where an employee merely expresses a view
on some topical issue, an issue having nothing to do with his organization's core mission, but which is deemed out of
bounds by people in power within the organization. 

Let us look at a paradigmatic case of bad cancel culture: the forced departure of CEO Brendan Eich from Mozilla,
the company that develops the Firefox web browser.
Eich is, among other things, the inventor of JavaScript, which is now one of the most popular programming languages in the
world. But he was "cancelled" when it was revealed that
he had donated to a campaign attempting block gay marriage in California. I think this is a clear example of the cancel
culture that people want to get rid of: Eich simply had an opinion that was unpopular with progressives in the
tech industry. Rather than exhibiting the tolerance that they so loudly proclaim as one of their special virtues, they showed
themselves to be completely intolerant of his simply disagreeing with them. It is worth noting that Eich
himself never recommended that people who *did* support gay marriage be dismissed from his company. Nor was support for
gay marriage any part of Mozilla's core mission, which was to "promote choice and innovation on the Internet."

Of course, the situation is quite different if an employee advocates views that run directly counter to the main
goals of the organization that they are working for. If someone posts "all Republicans are Nazis," while employed by the
Republican national committee, it is perfectly justified to fire that person. In that case, they would be putting
themselves directly in opposition to the organization's stated goals. Similarly, someone working for a Catholic charity
can legitimately be fired for advocating for abortion rights, just as it would be legitimate to fire an employee of an
abortion rights advocacy group for publicly declaring that "abortion is murder." And even some completely legal actions
are perfectly legitimate reasons for dismissal from a group if those actions directly counter the group's raison d'etre:
if you work for the worldwide council on promoting veganism, but are "outed" enjoying a 32-ounce porterhouse steak at
Peter Luger's, you have no legitimate complaint if you lose your job.

Are there any legitimate limits an organization might place on an employee's speech and action outside of work,
if they do not relate to the group's central mission? I would argue that there clearly are such limits.
For instance, looking back to Eich's case, if instead of just disagreeing with the legalization of gay marriage, he had
posted on social media "death to all the gays" we have a completely different story: now, gay coworkers really would
have a good reason to feel unsafe around this person. A company would be perfectly justified in firing someone who
posted this. (And if the poster responded that "I was just joking," then they should be fired for being too stupid to
hold any serious job.) Or imagine that some person is discovered to be flying a Nazi flag at his house: understandably,
this might make his Jewish co-workers feel more than a little threatened working with him. Again, I think dismissal in
this case would be perfectly justified.

Of course, the protesting employees at Mozilla would claim that Eich's position on gay marriage made *them* feel
threatened. This is where prudential judgment must come into play: Eich simply disagreed with them on a proposed change
in California's laws. *He* did not advocate violence against gays (as Nazis do against Jews), and, crucially, as noted
above, Eich was perfectly happy to work alongside people who were in favor of gay marriage. (Unlike Nazis, who want Jews
excluded from mainstream society.) If the board of Mozilla had had any courage, they would have told the outraged
employees "You're the one's being intolerant: work with your new CEO, who is perfectly happy to work with you, or
leave."

Let us turn to the case of Salinas: if a healthcare worker repeatedly and openly advocates the death of people who
disagree with her politics, that is a pretty good sign that she should be removed from any medical position where she
might have any influence on their health or well-being. That is a lot different than if she had merely said "I think
Trump is an awful president," or "the Supreme Court is making bad decisions," or "I completely disagree with the
Republican Party's platform." If that had been what she were up to, and some right-winger tried to get her fired, then I would
certainly agree that that was a hypocritical employment of cancel culture by the right, after they had criticized it on
the part of the left. But the repeated advocacy of violence in her tweets puts them in a whole different ballpark than
merely strongly disagreeing with certain policies.

So what about Elez? Here, I am inclined to disagree with Musk (and J.D. Vance, who also defended his re-hire).
The tech industry happens to be pretty chock full of Indians: how are they supposed to work comfortably with a man who
wants to "normalize hate" against them? Note how different Elez's remarks were from if he had merely said "I think we
are importing too many Indian programmers; let's find Americans for those jobs." *That* would be more akin to Eich's
situation: a disagreement about policy. The left is partially guilty here for creating a situation in which actual,
clear expressions of hatred towards some group get a pass: by falsely calling almost any disagreement with leftist
policies as stemming from hatred, they prompted an over-reaction in the other direction.

Now perhaps Elez has expressed sincere regret for those remarks. Musk is obviously more aware of the actual situation
with this young man than am I, which is why I say I am only "inclined" to disagree. In any case, complaints about cancel
culture are often on target: people way too often have been turning legitimate disagreements about political policies into a
reason too destroy a person's career. But that in no way means that *absolutely anything* someone does or says outside
of work is not a reason for their dismissal. And, unfortunately for those who wish for systems so perfect that no
one needs to be good, it is only our prudential judgment that can separate the sheep from the goats in this regard.
