# The New Alchemists

Gene Callahan

AI researchers have achieved genuine breakthroughs in the ability of computers
to process language, sounds, and images over the last decade. But these
significant technical accomplishments have been accompanied by a constellation
of non-technical claims about what these advances mean.

For instance, Elon Musk [has
predicted](https://www.ft.com/content/027b133f-f7e3-459d-95bf-8afd815ae23d)
that AI will "overtake" human intelligence "next year." *Forbes Magazine*
worries (or hopes?) that ["Artificial Superintelligence Could Be Humanity's
Final Invention"](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2024/10/31/why-artificial-superintelligence-could-be-humanitys-final-invention/).
One of our leading new alchemists, Raymond Kurzweil,
asserts that we are entering into the age of "spiritual
machines." One can easily find a multitude of similar statements with a
simple Internet search. Behind these claims lies the fantasy that
the dilemma we face in our human
existence, of finding ourselves born into a world that we did not create and
whose purpose we do not know, can be solved by *technical* means.

Thus, it may be of interest to look into the past, at some similar enterprises
that achieved genuine technical breakthroughs, while accompanied by speculative
ideas of dubious validity. In doing so, we will make extensive use of Mircea
Eliade's book *The
Forge and the Crucible*. In it, he traces how the "ideology" associated with
metallurgy and mining gradually gave birth to alchemy, and how that ideology
was often utopian in its promises of what these new technologies could achieve.
(I don't particularly like this use of "ideology," but, having been unable to
come up with a better word, I will use Eliade's term.)

Eliade's central thesis is that early mining, early metallurgy, and alchemy were
all largely *spiritual* practices. That claim is likely surprising to many readers.
Typically, alchemy is thought of as primitive chemistry, attempting to turn lead
into gold, and metallurgy and mining as
purely practical activities. But Eliade demonstrates that all three fields
always involved mystical, occult ideologies that saw these activities as far
more than mere technical disciplines. As he put it:

"What the smelter, smith and alchemist have in common is that all three
lay claim to a particular magico-religious experience in their relations with
matter; this experience is their monopoly and its secret is transmitted through
the initiatory rights of their trades. All three work on a Matter which they
hold to be at once alive and sacred, and in their labours they pursue the
transformation of matter, its perfection and its transmutation." (8-9)
(Similarly, Kurzweil,
[writing in *The Economist*](https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2024/06/17/ray-kurzweil-on-how-ai-will-transform-the-physical-world),
promises that "AI will transform the physical world.")

Right up until the last few centuries, metallurgy and mining were surrounded by
mystical rites and attitudes. Creating new furnaces or new mines were preceded
by periods of ritual purity that culminated in sacrificial rites; Eliade writes
"the transformation of holy matter (which is what metal is) demands for its
accomplishment the sacrifice of a human being."
Regarding primitive metallurgy, Eliade notes that "Very early on we are confronted with
the notion that ores 'grow' in the belly of the Earth after the manner of
embryos." (8) (Much in the way that large language models are supposed
to be growing in knowledge as they are being programmed.)

Indeed, the tools of these trades themselves were regarded as magical, per
Eliade: "The tools of the smith also shared the sacred quality. The hammer,
the bellows, and the anvil are revealed to be animate miraculous objects. They
were regarded as capable of operating by their own magico-religious force,
unassisted by the smith." (Just as LLMs are regarded as capable of 
understanding their input and learning from it, unassisted by the programmer.)

Eliade traces the ideology behind alchemy to its origin in earlier work with
metals:

"To sum up: in the symbols and rites accompanying metallurgical operations
there comes into being the idea of an active collaboration of man and nature,
perhaps even the belief that man, by his own work, is capable of superseding
the process of nature." (75)

Roger Bacon, often considered a forerunner of the Scientific Revolution,
wrote about alchemy as a "medicine, which gets rid of impurities and all
blemishes from the most base metal, can wash unclean things from the body and
prevents decay of the body to such an extent that it prolongs life by several
centuries" 167

Compare this to AI promoter Dario Amodei's claims in his essay, ["Machines of
Loving Grace"](https://darioamodei.com/machines-of-loving-grace):

"But I suspect AI-accelerated biology will greatly expand what is possible:
weight, physical appearance, reproduction, and other biological processes will
be fully under people's control. We'll refer to these under the heading of
biological freedom: the idea that everyone should be empowered to choose what
they want to become and live their lives in the way that most appeals to
them... [so] that most of those currently alive today will be able to live as long
as they want."

Eliade says of the mystical metallurgist and alchemist that,
"in taking upon himself the responsibility of changing Nature, man put himself
in the place of Time; that which would have required millennia or aeons to
'ripen' in the depths of the earth, the metallurgist and alchemist claim to be
able to achieve in a few weeks." 169

Similarly, the AI alchemist tries to duplicate an evolution of consciousness
that took hundreds of millions of years in the time it takes to train an LLM.
The *Forbes* article linked to above says "Unlike human intelligence, which is
constrained by biology, ASI would operate at digital speeds... Imagine a being
that could read and understand every scientific paper ever written in an
afternoon..." (Since computers have operated at many diffferent speeds, I have
no idea what "digital speeds" are.) All of humanity's understanding of the
natural world, achieved over many millenia, will be surpassed in an afternoon!
[*Time Magazine*](https://time.com/6310115/ai-revolution-reshape-the-world/)
claims that "We are facing a step change in what's possible for
individual people to do, and at a previously unthinkable pace."


The old alchemists sought to perfect matter by, for instance, turning base metals into gold.
(This is the kernel of truth at the core of the common misapprehension of alchemists as seekers of wealth by turning
lead into gold: they did, indeed, seek the recipe for transforming "base" metals into gold,
but this was because gold was "spiritually pure," and not because it was more expensive.)
As Eliade writes, "Alchemical transmutation is therefore equivalent to the perfecting of matter or, in Christian
terminology, to its redemption." (151)
Our new alchemists instead
seek to perfect matter by turning stupid matter into matter that can compute.
In  *The Age of Spiritual Machines*, Kurzweil says,
"The point of all these... numbers is that extremely
little of the stuff on earth is devoted to useful computation. This is even more true when we consider all the dumb
matter in the earth's [core]." (259)

And like how the alchemy of old "delivers Nature from its own laws" (Eliade, 130),
so does the new alchemy: "The laws of physics are not
repealed by intelligence, but they effectively evaporate in its presence." (Kurzweil, 260)

Lest anyone doubt that a practitioner can make enormous technical advances
while yet embracing a dubious ideology, we offer you... Isaac Newton and alchemy.

John Maynard Keynes was upset by the low price that Isaac Newton's papers had
fetched at auction, and so he began buying them up himself. Whilst doing so, he
uncovered Newton's enduring interest in alchemy, a subject to which he devoted
more time than he did to mathematics or physics.

This led Keynes to call Newton
["the last of the magicians."](https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2011/januaryfebruary/feature/newton-the-last-magician)
(However, Keynes himself might
be considered a latter-day magician, his theories transforming profligate
spending and useless work into prosperity. In fact, Eliade saw the "systems of
political economy" as carrying forward the alchemist's dream.)

As an example of what Newton spent a large amount of his time doing,
consider this line in Newton's recipe for "sophic mercury," which dissolved gold and
allowed the precious metal to "vegetate" and mature into the philosopher's
stone: "Marry [sulfur] with... [mercury] which is impregnated with [and]
must be espoused with our gold then hast thou two sulphurs married & two... of
one of[f]spring whose father is the [gold] & [silver] the mother."

Eliade himself explicitly recognized that the alchemist's dream has not died with the
death of alchemy: "the idea of a new Epoch, crystallized around the myth of
infinite progress and boosted by the experimental sciences, and the progress of
industrialization which dominated and inspired the whole of the 19th century,
takes up and carries forward... the millennary dream of the alchemist...
visionaries myth of the perfection... of Nature survives, in camouflage form,
in the pathetic program of the industrial societies, whose aim is the total
Transmutation of nature." (172)


No one today would suggest that, in order to appreciate stainless steel cutlery
or iron grill work, we must sacrifice chickens in a new furnace, or that
to form a metal alloy requires sexual purity on the part of the metallurgist.
Nor do we have to be ready to celebrate the marriage of mercury and sulphur,
and its offspring, the philosopher's stone, in order to appreciate
Newton's theory of gravity or the calculus.

Similarly, we can appreciate the genuine technical advances being achieved by
today's AI shamans without buying into their occult fantasies of creating
"spiritual machines" or fundamentally altering human existence
by passing magical incantations over silicon crystals.

Furthermore, we ought to recognize that the technological "utopias," whether
those of the earlier alchemists, or those of our modern, AI alchemists, do not
even address the fundamental mystery of human existence: what are our lives
*for*? If I have no idea *why* I am alive, or what I ought to be doing while I
am, simply extending the span of my life and making it easier for me to avoid
disease and hardship only means drawing out my existential angst over a
longer and longer stretch of meaningless existence.

Kurzweil and his ilk never seem to consider if these "silicon-based humans" need a purpose.
Let us say we grant that his fantasy of a world in which most "humans" are actually
machines comes true, won't any of them ever ask "What is the point of all this computation we are doing?"
Or will they be fully satisfied simply to compute more and more things, faster
and faster, without any clue about for what end they perform all of these calculations?
