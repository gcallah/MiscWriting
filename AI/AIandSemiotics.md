# AI and Semiotics


What a computer outputs is a string of zeros and ones. It only refers to anything else when humans treat it as so
referring. It is we who decide what computer doing is "playing music," and so we send the output to a speaker, or
"painting," and so we send the output to the screen or a color printer, or "writing," and so we take the string of ones
and zeros and turn them into letters and punctuation marks.

But we could make other choices: we could take the output of an AI that is supposedly a painting program, and send it to
our speakers. It might sound wonderful, or it might sound awful, but it demonstrates that the computer never *intended*
anything in the operations it was performing. There was never any referent in the world outside the computing machine
which the computer's operations *meant*. If, at a backyard barbecue with some friends, I exclaim,
"There's a man behind that tree!" I am not emitting a mere pattern of
"information" about which I am indifferent as to whether my audience chooses to interpret as a musical composition, or a
graphic image, or even a sentence of English considered as a grammatical example or as something interesting
someone once said in a novel or movie. No, my sentence exhibit thirdness, it is *about* something outside of itself.
Unless I am "just joking," I at least mean that:

1. There is a tree in the backyard
2. Behing it I believe I see a man.

And most likely, T
