# Did Tocqueville foresee America's current malaise?

In a *Commonweal* symposium on Patrick Deneen's *Why Liberalism Failed*, both
Deneen's critics, 
Samuel Moyn and Bryan Garsten of Yale University and Commonweal’s Matthew
Sitmanç
and  Deneen himself, focus an unusual amount of attention on how to correctly
interpret Alexis de Tocqueville's famous work, *Democracy in America*.

Why, nearly 200 years after its publication, does this work still hold such
sway in discussing American politics? Well, for one thing, Tocqueville offered
certain prognoses that seem almost prophetic: that the expansion of the 
British population of North America across the continent was nearly inevitable,
or that the two great powers of the future would be the United States and
Russia.

But what is more important, in terms of "looking backward to move forward," are
Tocqueville's comments on the weaknesses and strengths of American democracy.
How many of the roots of our current malaise were already present when
Tocqueville toured the US? If the answer is, "Most of them," then it is not
useful to point the finger at Wilson, or FDR, or "the 60s," as bearing the
brunt of the blame for our current condition.

Therefore, re-examining the work of perhaps the greatest observer of American
democracy should prove helpful in our present situation.
