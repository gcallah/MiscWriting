# Who’s a Settler Colonialist Now?

There's been a lot of attention paid lately, to just to our indigenous people in some area, and who are not.
Those who are not deemed indigenous are often referred to as engaged in "settler colonialism."

But why should we care about who qualifies as "indigenous" in some place and who doesn’t? 
Well, the basic idea is that the indigenous people were there first, and some other group came along later, and pushed
them aside. In recognition for having suffered an historical injustice, the indigenous people are entitled to certain
rights and protections, or so the prevalent theory goes.

So, then, who is indigenous? My Meriam-Webster dictionary has the following definition:
"indigenous: of or relating to the earliest known inhabitants of a place..."

This is a simple, fairly straightforward definition to apply. Of course, given new archaeological evidence, we might
find that some previously unknown inhabitants had been in some locale before the people who up till then had been
thought to be the indigenous population. But we would not expect that to happen very often. So it should be fairly easy
to decide just who is indigenous, and who a settler colonist, right?

However, I was recently at a lecture by Marian Pastor Roces on Austronesian culture. She mentioned that the Philippines
were first settled 47,000 years ago. The Austronesians arrived on the islands 4000 years ago and almost completely
displaced the people who had been there. (The original inhabitants left their trace in the "Negritos" of the islands,
who, nevertheless, have mixed with Austronesians and speak Austronesian languages.) Yet several times later in the
lecture she referred to the artifacts produced by the Austronesians as "indigenous" Filipino culture.

This is curious: weren't the ancestors of the Negritos the indigenous people of the Phillipines? And doesn't the
Austronesian takeover of the archipelago fit the "settler colonialism" concept to a T? After all, the Austronesians
wiped out the indigenous culture so thoroughly that not one of the indigenous languages survives.


In Southern Africa, as Wikipedia notes, "[Southwards moving Bantu people] displaced, conquered, and absorbed the
original Khoisan, Khoikhoi and San peoples." Dutch settlers often allied with the indigenous (?) people resisting Bantu
incursions. Nevertheless, several paragraphs later, Wikipedia describes the people living in South Africa as the Dutch,
the English, and the indigenous people... despite the fact that many of the people lumped into the indigenous category
were recent invaders attempting to subjugate the people who were actually indigenous by the Meriam-Webster definition!


Celtic people (including my ancestors) only arrived in Ireland in roughly the third millennium BC, largely displacing
the culture of the existing inhabitants of the island, which had been settled for several thousand years before the
Celts showed up. Again, the Celts would appear to be, by any neutral definition, classic "settler colonialists." But
bizarrely, a group of people that only split off from mainstream Irish culture in about 1600, the Travellers, are now
deemed "indigenous." (See https://public-history-weekly.degruyter.com/10-2022-2/unsilencing-indigenous-ireland/) Their
claim to being indigenous seems to mostly rest on the fact that the rest of the Irish population, whose ancestors mostly
arrived at just the same time as those of the Travellers, don't particularly fancy them.

All of the languages of northern India are languages of invading Indo-Europeans, who migrated to an area that
had already given birth to the Indus Valley civilization. The subcontinent was then invaded again by nomadic Muslims.
The British were the third main invading culture to dominate India. But in another weird twist, the Muslim people
of Kashmir are now being termed "indigenous," while Hindus are being accused of settler colonialism in the area. (See
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/dech.12809.)

The utter absurdity of some of these employments of "indigenous" and "settler colonialism" demonstrates that these terms
are not being used in any objective or impartial manner. (Indeed, my suggestion that they ought to be used impartially
will probably be accused of forwarding the settler colonialist concept of "impartiality.") Instead of being
founded in serious intellectual analysis of the situations under consideration, they are instead pieces of partisan
propaganda: in some conflict, just designate the side you favor as "indigenous," and the side you don't like as "settler
colonialist," and... you win!

The importance tied to the issue of just who is indigenous, and who is a settler colonialist has been raised to even
greater prominence by the current conflict in Gaza, where both sides try to contend they are "more indigenous" than the
other. That such an question could possibly have any definitive answer in a region like the Middle East, the history of
which has been characterized by thousands and thousands of years of conquests and migrations, is ridiculous: both the
Israelis and the Palestinians in the area most likely have some ancestors who were in the area millemia ago,
and some ancestors who were more recent invaders of the land. To invoke "settler colonialism" in this conflict is an
attempt to avoid serious consideration of what a just resolution of the present dispute might entail, and instead play
the "I'm more indigenous than you" as a trump card.

The paths of men are twisted, and any attempt to draw a simple morality play out of that tangle must do violence to
historical reality. Every single one of us has ancestors who did something terrible to some other people, as well as
ancestors who were victims of something terrible being done to them.
How could we possibly apportion guilt amongst the earth's present population based on what their ancestors were up to,
when every single family tree will contain innumerable oppressors and oppressed?
However much we might wish to undo all settler colonialism, we can’t possibly put everyone back where they "came from,"
or all eight billion of us will have to crowd into East Africa. We can’t restore all lands to their original inhabitants:
who will get, for instance, the Philippines? Should we assign ownership by upon percentage of Negrito DNA each person has?

We cannot make the past more just than it was: it lies beyond our reach. It is only the future that we can make more
just. And I suggest that trying to assign blame to living people for things done by their remote ancestors is a barrier,
rather than a step, towards doing so.

Then the Moghuls


The Italic people invaded Italy


The Zulu invaded South Africa


The Barbarous Years


Not one of the descendants of settler colonists actually decided to be born where they were.


Patrick Wolfe was himself a "settler colonist," moving from his native England to Australia!
