# Interview with Musa al-Gharbi


Certainly people sometimes believe things because it is in their self interest to do so,
but I get an uneasy feeling more things that start to be explained that way.
Did Marx *really* Believe in scientific materialism, or was it just in his class interest to say he did?

What about Asians?


Isn't spelling Black with a B the  kind of empty gesture you are discussing?


Should people feel guilty about using DoorDash, Uber, and Lyft? If the people working those gig jobs had a better
alternative, when they be doing that already?


You claim the "wealth" of Uber etc. is "derived" from the workers... but doesn't the software also account for a
portion of that wealth?
(I favor trying to set up worker-owned work sharing apps.)

Can universities really "set rents" at whatever level they want?
