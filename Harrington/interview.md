no, you go ahead.

8
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.989
Eugene Callahan: Yeah, I thought you were asking me if I needed a treat.

9
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:44.709
Eugene Callahan: So, my…

10
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:45.300
Mary Harrington: I have.

11
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:56.300
Eugene Callahan: I've become convinced that there's a… it's a… to do it right, it's a process of translation. It's a lot
like taking a novel to film or something like that.

12
00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:13.730
Eugene Callahan: And when I look at the transcript, what you've got is, you know, someone gets asked a question, they
go, well, the thing is, I once… no, no, no, let's not go into that. It's, you know, maybe I should. And, you know, no
one needs to be reading that stream of pauses and…WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:07.970
Eugene Callahan: I almost forgot to turn on recording, that would have been a real problem.

2
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.330
Mary Harrington: I don't think… I don't think we've missed anything critical there, really, have we?

3
00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:18.460
Eugene Callahan: Yeah, no, we're okay, but if I had gone on much longer, then I would have been very embarrassed.

4
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:27.179
Eugene Callahan: But, so, I've become convinced that… Sorry, go ahead.

5
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.369
Mary Harrington: No, no, I was just calling the dog.

6
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.259
Eugene Callahan: Oh, alright. Okay. I thought you wanted me to sit.

7
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.929
Mary Harrington: No, no, 

13
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:25.780
Eugene Callahan: You know, ellipses and so forth, right? So… but what I do is, I've given each person I've interviewed the transcript, the edited transcript, and I try to be very scrupulous

14
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.800
Eugene Callahan: And making sure I'm conveying what they were thinking.

15
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:31.450
Mary Harrington: Cool.

16
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.839
Eugene Callahan: Right, so… and so you'll get a transcript, and you'll get a chance

17
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.590
Eugene Callahan: say, no, you misinterpreted me here, that's not what I meant.

18
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.250
Mary Harrington: I mean, yeah, yeah, that sounds absolutely fine, or…

19
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.950
Eugene Callahan: Yeah.

20
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.529
Mary Harrington: That sounds completely fine.

21
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.190
Eugene Callahan: And so far, I've had no complaints. No one ever, said that,

22
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.929
Eugene Callahan: I had misrepresented them, so hopefully that will continue.

23
00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:09.020
Eugene Callahan: All right, so, there'll be questions I'm gonna ask where, I know… I think I know the answer, in terms of your work, but it'd be good for the readers of modern age to

24
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:16.609
Eugene Callahan: Hear what you have to say. So let's start out on the topic of technology.

25
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.599
Eugene Callahan: And, how did print change human lives?

26
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:33.339
Mary Harrington: I literally just finished writing a chapter about that today, at least I think I finished it. I hope I finished it. I probably never finished it. I mean, it's sort of difficult to start

27
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:50.020
Mary Harrington: or say anything very comprehensive about this succinctly, because it changed everything. I mean, I've titled the chapter The Modernity Machine, because in my view, the printing press is… it's the foundational technology of modernity.

28
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:58.370
Mary Harrington: You know, which is itself a vague term. I mean, your magazine is called Modern Age, but what precisely do you mean by modern? You know, you can go down a whole philosophical rabbit hole with that.

29
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.119
Eugene Callahan: Yeah, well, I didn't name it, so…

30
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:17.110
Mary Harrington: It's like, you know it when you see it, right? There's an indefinable thing that happens. There's a sort of this-ness which comes into being, and people sort of wave their arms around and talk about the spirit of the age, or, you know, transformation of ideas and a genealogy of this or that.

31
00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:30.510
Mary Harrington: And I find Elizabeth Eisenstein, who's an historian, persuasive in her argument that actually what almost all of these histories of ideas leave out, or relied, or simply take for granted is the material contribution of print to all of these changes.

32
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:41.229
Mary Harrington: I mean, I said… I sent the chapter to a friend earlier this evening, saying it was just an absolute headache to write. It was like trying to get an octopus into a fishnet stocking.

33
00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:48.119
Mary Harrington: There's probably still tentacles flopping around where there shouldn't be, just generally. It's a very unruly subject, because…

34
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.810
Eugene Callahan: You've done… I've tried to put an octopus in a fishnet sucking?

35
00:03:51.810 --> 00:04:11.040
Mary Harrington: I… it's not something I've ever actually tried, but it was… it has a… I wanted to convey the sense of elusiveness and slipperiness and just general things… things thrashing around where… in ways I didn't want them to. And always… being… no, it's not something I've ever tried, but I hope it's… I hope it's sort of, evocative.

36
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:19.700
Mary Harrington: But the… I've sort of narrowed… I've tried to throw out… some… thematic.

37
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:34.979
Mary Harrington: key points in… in this particular chapter. You see, I've already… I've already failed to do this succinctly, because this is just impossible to do succinctly. I think there are… I mean, what Eisenstein points to are two… two characteristics of print as a form.

38
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:45.340
Mary Harrington: Which were transformative. So it wasn't just that… it wasn't just that the ideas, carried by print changed things, but although they did, it was also two characteristics of print as a form.

39
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.639
Mary Harrington: Distinct from handwriting, which was the prevalent information technology of the manuscript age.

40
00:04:51.220 --> 00:05:00.790
Mary Harrington: Which, which were world-transforming. One of them was scale. There was just a lot more reading material than previously, and that had all sorts of complex feedback loop effects.

41
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.730
Mary Harrington: And the other effect was fixity.

42
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:16.669
Mary Harrington: And between… between them, those two, those two, attributes, material attributes of print as a form, invented progress, effectively. And the advancement of knowledge just wasn't a thing.

43
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.010
Mary Harrington: Prior to the printing press.

44
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:31.399
Mary Harrington: Because, you know, books would get eaten by insects, or muddled, garbled in translation. You couldn't copy diagrams. You know, it simply wasn't possible to do accurate science, because

45
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:40.509
Mary Harrington: After 3… you know, how many… how many ignorant copyists do you think can reproduce an intricate diagram of an aorta before it's just unrecognizable?

46
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:52.630
Mary Harrington: You know, it's not until you have woodcuts or engravings that any sort of accurate pictorial representations become possible. So there are entire vistas of human knowledge which can be sort of catalogued and

47
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.569
Mary Harrington: And developed and worked on in a sort of collaborative, distributive way.

48
00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.479
Mary Harrington: Through… and that only becomes possible through print.

49
00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:17.240
Mary Harrington: I think it's my… my thesis, although I wasn't really in the weeds of this today. My working hypothesis is that there was… there's a concurrent set of transformations in the prevailing culture, and really in the

50
00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:25.079
Mary Harrington: The mindset of individuals within that culture more plainly, it changed how people thought.

51
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:28.610
Mary Harrington: I mean, literacy as such,

52
00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:48.049
Mary Harrington: there's pretty good evidence that it just changes people at a fundamental level, and sort of irreversibly as well. You know, the brain… the literate brain is different to the non-literate brain, you know, in a way which you sort of… once you've… once you've got that, you can't… once you've seen it, once you can pass the little symbols, you can't unread them again. You can't forget how to do that without some sort of significant brain damage.

53
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.050
Mary Harrington: Right.

54
00:06:49.050 --> 00:07:05.340
Mary Harrington: And once you… and again, this theme of scale, once you scale that up to a very much larger proportion of the population, something fundamental changes about what that culture is like, and how that culture approaches reality, and all sorts of things, from sort of time and memory.

55
00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:12.290
Mary Harrington: And what constitutes knowledge, what constitutes reality, how you assume time, or history, or… Anything works.

56
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.530
Mary Harrington: programs.

57
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.920
Mary Harrington: All… all sort of changed, not overnight, over a period of… over a period of, you know, really some…

58
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.610
Mary Harrington: time, but I… but I…

59
00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:32.359
Mary Harrington: my… my… again, my thesis is that the inflection point for a lot of these changes, the three in particular that I wanted to look at.

60
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:39.379
Mary Harrington: Which are nation-state, democracy in the 17th century, at least in the English-speaking world.

61
00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.709
Mary Harrington: And,

62
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:48.640
Mary Harrington: Left us with a settlement, the broad outlines of which, you know, with some contestation we've had more or less ever since, until recently.

63
00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:54.839
Mary Harrington: And now, the digital revolution is merely undoing a lot of those changes.

64
00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:59.519
Mary Harrington: And I think we're now embarking on a very interesting

65
00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:03.519
Mary Harrington: Period of doing the 17th century again, but in reverse.

66
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:06.250
Eugene Callahan: Now, with,

67
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:17.060
Eugene Callahan: these ideas in mind, I… in prepping, I reread a bunch of your recent, Substack posts, and so this was in my head.

68
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:29.940
Eugene Callahan: And my son and I were watching an American football game, and there's this very elaborate thing someone does catching a pass where they have to get both feet inbounds for it to be a catch. And I said, could you imagine our ancestors

69
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:37.790
Eugene Callahan: Finding out that this would be a really highly paid skill, that you could catch a ball and then do this little…

70
00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:40.210
Eugene Callahan: Intricate dance with your feet.

71
00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:55.840
Eugene Callahan: And he said, well, you know, we've always had sports. And I said, yeah, but, you know, we never had sports with intricate rulebooks. I mean, a sport would be like, you two people run as fast as you can, and whoever gets down there first wins.

72
00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:58.239
Eugene Callahan: It's only with print.

73
00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:00.939
Eugene Callahan: That you can have sports with

74
00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:14.170
Eugene Callahan: 400-page rulebooks that people are supposed to… the referees are supposed to absorb, and the players and coaches as much as they can. So, even with something as mundane as how a sport is played.

75
00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:22.520
Eugene Callahan: I think that, this transformation, I think sports are fundamentally different because.

76
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:41.870
Mary Harrington: Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. I mean, you can trace that genealogy, actually, back through English football. I mean, I don't know anything at all about the history of American football, so I'll spare you my speculations there. But English football originated back in unknown, illiterate times. There's a game called Shrovetide football.

77
00:09:41.870 --> 00:10:00.130
Mary Harrington: Which basically has no rules at all, apart from two goals about a mile apart and a roundish object, and then the rest of it is basically just barely contained rioting, where two very sort of loosely demarcated sides sort of have a riot and try and get the ball to…

78
00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:14.499
Mary Harrington: the… to their preferred end. Everyone drinks a lot of beer, and it's basically a sort of minimally, minimally constrained, opportunity to just have a big, enjoyable, beery fight. It's still played once a year on Shrovete, in the north of England.

79
00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:17.890
Eugene Callahan: We actually, in my grammar school…

80
00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:18.560
Mary Harrington: comfortable.

81
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:23.819
Eugene Callahan: a game much like that, without the beer. On an asphalt parking lot.

82
00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:31.820
Eugene Callahan: All right, so, you're all…

83
00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:33.530
Mary Harrington: There are, there are variants.

84
00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.019
Mary Harrington: Yeah, I mean, kids…

85
00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:37.950
Eugene Callahan: up a little bit sometimes, I think.

86
00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:44.940
Mary Harrington: reverse engineer, you know, unsupervised little boys will reverse engineer a version that's sort of deep in their DNA.

87
00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:45.510
Eugene Callahan: Yep.

88
00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:46.150
Mary Harrington: Oh.

89
00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:59.809
Mary Harrington: Bob Bermuda Triangle, I forgot. I'm on a footpath which goes through a little Bermuda Triangle, for some reason. I don't know. Hopefully, hopefully I'll pick up again once I pass it. Tell me, can you hear me all right? Yeah, this is good.

90
00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.960
Eugene Callahan: But what did radio and television do to the world created by print?

91
00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:21.800
Mary Harrington: I mean, your man for this is not me, it's Marshall McLuhan, really. Right. I mean, I can… you know, the book that made him famous was the Gutenberg Galaxy, which was published back in the 1960s, where he basically made the case that the beginning of the electric age

92
00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:32.060
Mary Harrington: was the end of the print era, so really quite a long time ago. And the, you know, the advent of radio and TV were the gradual return of

93
00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:39.590
Mary Harrington: Of orality, sort of what Walter Omn calls a secondary orality, back into… back into culture.

94
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:55.320
Mary Harrington: Which he thought would come with a return to some of the… some of the sort of consciousness attributes. This is McLuhan talking. I'm not, sort of, I'm not proposing my own precise series, but McLuhan thought that some of the attributes of a… of a non-literate consciousness would start to reemerge.

95
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:58.840
Mary Harrington: A sort of mythic approach to reality.

96
00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:02.989
Mary Harrington: More… more heightened emotionality, more,

97
00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:19.820
Mary Harrington: more tribalism. I mean, you know, you look at… you look at how… how the counterculture erupted, and the way… the way our world has developed since the two world wars, and you think, I don't know, maybe he was onto something. But I sort of feel like the revolution happened gradually, and then all at once with the internet.

98
00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:24.019
Mary Harrington: And that, in a sense, that crystallized something which had been latent.

99
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:35.220
Mary Harrington: in broadcast media, perhaps because broadcast media are broadcast. You know, there's only… there's only so far the picture can fragment, as long as there is… there are still these, structural

100
00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:45.419
Mary Harrington: sort of forces the gatekeep, who has the microphone, which is basically more or less the situation you have with TV, even, you know, even as channels proliferate.

101
00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:52.019
Mary Harrington: But then the internet comes along, and all of that is suddenly very much up for grabs.

102
00:12:53.520 --> 00:13:07.110
Mary Harrington: Everybody's curating their own, sort of, personal feed of whatever it is that they want, and, you know, the race to the bottom feels as though it's been very, very sudden, and a lot of people are still reeling slightly with shock, thinking, well, what just happened?

103
00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:15.099
Mary Harrington: And, I mean, I think it's still happening, and we've got some way, some considerable distance, some considerable amount.

104
00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:16.020
Mary Harrington: -Oh.

105
00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:22.320
Eugene Callahan: Alright, I lost you there at the end of that.

106
00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:25.380
Eugene Callahan: Oh.

107
00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:26.950
Mary Harrington: Afternoon.

108
00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:34.920
Eugene Callahan: No, what you're saying there is not coming through at all.

109
00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:38.970
Eugene Callahan: I just hear the fact that you're speaking.

110
00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.940
Eugene Callahan: Yeah, for about the last minute.

111
00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:02.870
Eugene Callahan: Awesome.

112
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:05.150
Mary Harrington: myself that question fairly often as well.

113
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.949
Eugene Callahan: Okay, so Mary, for about the last minute.

114
00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:17.879
Eugene Callahan: No words came through. I could hear that you were speaking, but there was no audible words. So, the connection is a little shaky.

115
00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:21.030
Mary Harrington: Can you hear me now?

116
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:23.170
Eugene Callahan: Yes, it's good now, this is clear.

117
00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:23.880
Mary Harrington: Thank you.

118
00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.059
Mary Harrington: I'm not sure what was going on before, my…

119
00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:28.110
Eugene Callahan: Yeah.

120
00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:33.250
Mary Harrington: Sorry, there's always these, hiccups of one kind or another.

121
00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:41.120
Eugene Callahan: Yeah, I do like… I mean, I get a transcript at the end of this, and that really makes life easier for me, so that's why I want to try…

122
00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:46.750
Eugene Callahan: But, we are having a little bit of, transmission difficulty. So, let's,

123
00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:53.379
Eugene Callahan: So, some people might push back On the idea that,

124
00:14:54.180 --> 00:15:01.309
Eugene Callahan: that… well, it, you know, I don't know, I think it's kind of strange that they're pushing back, but they do, and

125
00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:07.589
Eugene Callahan: They might say, well, you know, the phone, the smartphone, it's just a new tool,

126
00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:20.129
Eugene Callahan: people like David Chalmers have put out the extended mind hypothesis, that our minds actually are, you know, reside in our brains, but in our tools, in our books, in our…

127
00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:29.200
Eugene Callahan: You know, a shovel is a part of our mind because it's shaped so that we can dig with it properly, and once you learn to use it.

128
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:40.230
Eugene Callahan: part of you, Michael Polanyi, talks about how the blind man's stick becomes an extension of the blind man's arm, and they actually feel the world with the tip of the stick.

129
00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:53.650
Eugene Callahan: So someone might say, well, these bones, they're just another element of extended mind, you know, this… we've been doing this with technology since we began chipping rocks, and…

130
00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:54.450
Eugene Callahan: And…

131
00:15:54.450 --> 00:16:03.029
Mary Harrington: Well, I think… I think that's true, but it doesn't… it's not a… it's not a rebuttal. In a sense, it's, you know, it doesn't… it doesn't really do anything except…

132
00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:21.650
Mary Harrington: elaborate… explain the same thesis, but from a different angle, and say it's… it's fine, actually. And I'm… and to be… let me be clear. I'm not saying that any of this is necessarily bad. I think it comes with some… with some downsides that people haven't… that people who like the modern world have perhaps not appreciated.

133
00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:32.200
Mary Harrington: But it also comes with some significant upsides, because it's… the entry into modernity was not cost-free, right? You know, all this… the world is full of people shroud-waving about disenchantment and the like.

134
00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:40.550
Mary Harrington: Or, you know, moaning about… moaning about the atomizing and ecosidal impact of, industrial technologies, or what have you. You know, all of these… all of these are…

135
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:54.670
Mary Harrington: not so desirable byproducts of modernity, you know, which we tend to kind of look past because we quite like the washing machines. I mean, you'll fryze my washing machine from my cold, dead hands, you know, no matter how mournfully I wring my hands about.

136
00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:57.260
Mary Harrington: Modernity, or water tables, or pollution, or whatever.

137
00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:11.300
Mary Harrington: So, yeah, I mean, that's a… that's a hypocrisy, or a sort of double… a double-think that I think even… even, vociferous technology critics are… are actually sort of tacitly quite comfortable with.

138
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:29.699
Mary Harrington: But, what I think we can still be attentive to, is… and again, here, I'm really… I'm mostly just sort of channeling Marshall McLuhan. I think you can… without saying that the effect of a particular extension, which again is a McLuhan-ish term, and I forget who…

139
00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:41.149
Mary Harrington: the name of the guy that you cited. But without saying that an extension is good or bad, we can… we can explore what it does and how… how it extends our,

140
00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:51.669
Mary Harrington: How it extends our abilities, and what… what perhaps is… what… what… and whether there are other abilities, for example, that we might lose as a trade-off for extending those capacities.

141
00:17:52.080 --> 00:18:04.700
Mary Harrington: You know, in the same sense that, you know, creatures that live under the water, underground, develop acutely sensitized hearing, for example, that aren't particularly good at seeing things, because they just don't need to. You know, I think this is,

142
00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:22.739
Mary Harrington: you know, you hyper-attune the senses that you're… that you're focused into, and perhaps allow the other ones to atrophy somewhat. And, you know, just to say, you know, to be attentive to what is atrophying, I think, is not the same as saying, oh, this is bad and we must return, because that's just not going to happen, right?

143
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:41.679
Mary Harrington: You know, but I think… I think it's perfectly legitimate to… to be curious, about what… what we run the risk of attributing in the course of developing a new extension, and perhaps to suggest, politely, that it might be worth being a little bit intentional about how, or how quickly, or to what extent, we allow

144
00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:53.809
Mary Harrington: faculties to atrophy. I mean, just to concretize this a little bit more, I mean, one of the… one of the books I've been really enjoying reading, lately, in the context of thinking about how consciousness shifted

145
00:18:53.810 --> 00:19:05.089
Mary Harrington: with the advent of the printing press, as Mary Carruthers. I don't know if she's still alive now, but she wrote a book in the late 20th century on the art of memory, which is to say, medieval nemotechnics.

146
00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:17.470
Mary Harrington: Which is a whole series of practices for remembering stuff from an age when books were just incredibly rare, and you might, like, get one go on the Codex, and then it goes back in the cupboard, and that's it, and then you have to go home, that's it, you never see it again.

147
00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:36.569
Mary Harrington: You can't take photocopies, there isn't spare paper to write stuff down, you just have to remember it. And people were amazingly good at this. And this is a set of techniques which, you know, apart from sort of card trick guys, and, you know, fairground entertainers, and just nerds who like to show off, and just eccentric people, it's almost completely neglected.

148
00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:44.630
Mary Harrington: as a set of cognitive tools, but it's incredibly effective. And this was just completely standard practice for them for well-educated medievals.

149
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:57.550
Mary Harrington: was to develop what they would… what they would have thought of as a designed memory. You would literally… you would construct your memory, and they… they had all these very vivid metaphors for what they were doing. They would describe it as a series of pigeonholes, or the cells in a honeycomb.

150
00:19:57.550 --> 00:20:05.240
Mary Harrington: Or, you know, a series of… or a treasure box, or… and they're all… they're all these… these metaphors for containers, really, containers of precious things.

151
00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:16.220
Mary Harrington: Or living things, or… and very, very plainly, what they were doing was a very methodical kind of inward filing. And these are practices that we just don't have anymore, because we don't need them.

152
00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:26.280
Mary Harrington: And you can say… you… you can say, well, well, so what? You know, we… no, we just have Google, or whatever. But you can also… but you can also be attentive to… to what changes.

153
00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:45.219
Mary Harrington: When a set of techniques like that are lost, and with it, and with the atrophying of medieval nemotechnics. So I'm not even sure if that's exactly how you pronounce it. But with the atrophying of that as a set of necessary skills, which every educated person needed to learn. They also lost an entire method of

154
00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:53.839
Mary Harrington: composing… composing arguments. An entire… an entire vocab… visual vocabulary, for… for illustrating arguments.

155
00:20:53.990 --> 00:21:07.569
Mary Harrington: And a whole… a whole panoply of other, what had previously been elite, shared cultural reference points, all of which together makes up a huge portion of what… of the cultural color of medieval thought.

156
00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:24.500
Mary Harrington: And it's… and the… the fact… the simple fact that we just don't learn that stuff anymore is… and I'm quoting C.S. Lewis here, it's one of the… it's one of the biggest barriers between them and us. It's what… it's what makes the medieval so completely opaque. I actually think it's a ma… it's a major contributor to why so…

157
00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:34.659
Eugene Callahan: Why, you… major contributor to Y, and then you cut off.

158
00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:41.850
Eugene Callahan: I don't hear you at all now.

159
00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:48.949
Eugene Callahan: I don't know if you're hearing me.

160
00:21:58.350 --> 00:21:59.319
Mary Harrington: so many other…

161
00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:03.890
Mary Harrington: reaction.

162
00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:09.090
Mary Harrington: To… oh no, did you… don't tell me that you had the… that you didn't record any of that.

163
00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:15.179
Eugene Callahan: I lost you, it's a major contributor to…

164
00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:30.040
Mary Harrington: I think it's a major contributor to why, the… why so many otherwise extremely literate thinkers seem to just skip straight over, straight, straight from, say, Plato to Descartes, and just skip the entire Middle Ages.

165
00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:32.149
Eugene Callahan: As if, as if it just isn't there.

166
00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:51.599
Mary Harrington: I mean, there's a slightly more complex set of reasons for it as well, but I think a significant chunk of it is just down to the fact that not understanding how the medieval thought, because we don't understand how rhetoric and the art of memory works, just means that basically the subtleties of medieval thought is unintelligible to us.

167
00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.999
Mary Harrington: To a far more radical degree than people realize.

168
00:22:55.390 --> 00:23:14.560
Mary Harrington: I mean, it's a fairly extended analogy, but just sort of bringing it back to the question of phones and, oh, you know, isn't this just an extension of ourselves? Sure, yes, absolutely, that's completely true. That's absolutely what it is. However, I think… I bring up the medieval art of memory, as a… I think it's quite a precise analogy.

169
00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:26.590
Mary Harrington: for the kind of thing we need to be attentive to when we think about how… how something like a smartphone, for example, or the use of ChatGPT changes our relationship to the ideas that we use to think with.

170
00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:45.779
Mary Harrington: And changes… changes how… how we retain, or what we retain, or how we structure our approach to thinking. I think if it's possible for the loss of something like the art of memory to… to… to create so fundamental a sort of a cultural gulf between then and now.

171
00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:57.379
Mary Harrington: Then it stands to reason that an equivalent shift in our relationship to our storage and retrieval of ideas could very well have been

172
00:23:57.530 --> 00:24:07.829
Mary Harrington: an equivalently transformative effect, which could be good, or it could just… it could just sever the… the world as it's coming from the world as it is now.

173
00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:23.619
Mary Harrington: And I think this… I think it's worth being thoughtful about how we approach that, and it's worth doing… it's… if that's something… if that's a future that we want to walk into, I propose that we should do it with our eyes as open as possible, and not just… not just as the kids say, YOLO it.

174
00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:28.479
Eugene Callahan: Yeah. I teach software engineering, and

175
00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:46.749
Eugene Callahan: One thing I've noticed is that when something goes wrong with the program, it's important to focus on the error message and contemplate it and think about what this could be. And it's extremely hard for me to get my students to simply leave one screen alone

176
00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:53.509
Eugene Callahan: static on the monitor. They want to continually swipe from screen to screen.

177
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:54.060
Mary Harrington: Huh.

178
00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:58.329
Eugene Callahan: Makes it impossible to even read the message that they're getting.

179
00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:04.989
Eugene Callahan: So, there's a very mundane example, but it really is striking how

180
00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:11.089
Eugene Callahan: A little tolerance they have for having one fixed thing in front of them on the computer.

181
00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:31.260
Mary Harrington: Yeah, I mean, there are… there were some figures that popped up recently in the press about something like 1 in 3 kids that start school… start school in the United Kingdom simply doesn't know how to interact with a book, and they try and zoom it or swipe it as though it's an iPad. Which, I mean, I don't know, and again, maybe… maybe your guy might say, well, so what?

182
00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:32.053
Mary Harrington: No

183
00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:44.839
Mary Harrington: Except… except that there are… there's also pretty persuasive evidence. I think your… your guy for this, the citation for this, would be Nicholas Carr, who wrote The Shallows back in the… in the aughts.

184
00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:56.179
Mary Harrington: A prescient engagement with some of these information overload questions, where he cites a whole panoply of evidence to the effect that reading on a screen is different in kind.

185
00:25:56.180 --> 00:26:07.359
Mary Harrington: Reading, reading in that associative way that you do across multiple internet pages is different in kind, both in terms of the kind of thinking that you do, and the amount which is retained.

186
00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:24.359
Mary Harrington: to reading on a page, where, as it were, you have that fixed thing in front of you. Sometimes it's a long-form argument, and in the course of reading a long-form argument of that kind, thoughtfully over a period of time, you'll have a dialogue, not just with the author.

187
00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:27.519
Mary Harrington: In your own mind, once you're… once you're on reader level.

188
00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:46.499
Mary Harrington: is competent enough to be able to read swiftly. You'll find yourself reading, I'm sure you have this experience all the time. You're not just reading, but in the back of your mind, you're cross-referencing, or you're arguing back, or you're… so you're dialoguing with the text, but in a sense, your stored memory, your own memory palace, because we all have one to an extent.

189
00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:51.779
Mary Harrington: Is… is cross-referencing what's… what you're reading with other things that you've read.

190
00:26:51.870 --> 00:27:11.730
Mary Harrington: And again, you know, just to say, I'm not… I'm not violently anti-tech. I mean, one of the… one of the more interesting practices that I've noticed emerges amongst people who like to read and who are also somewhat online, is I'll find myself… I'll find myself absorbed in a book.

191
00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:20.499
Mary Harrington: But I also have in my mind 4 or 5 interlocutors who are interested in similar subjects, and occasionally I'll come across a… think of somebody, and I'll photograph the page and text it to them.

192
00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:35.139
Mary Harrington: And then there'll be a whole sort of secondary or tertiary dialogue, which really does feel like an extension of that expert reader dialogue, which people like Marianne Wolff and Nicholas Carr talk about. It feels like an externalization of that, which is mediated through the phone or the chat window.

193
00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:46.329
Mary Harrington: So it's not to say that these things are mutually exclusive, it's absolutely not. It's more about… it's more a question of intentionality and not confusing one thing for the other.

194
00:27:46.730 --> 00:28:02.120
Mary Harrington: I mean, you know, the Lord of the Rings makes… is a great series of movies. It's also a fantastic set of books. It's the same story, by and large, but, you know, nobody… nobody would… would sit through it in both forms and say there are no difference… there's no difference between them, right?

195
00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:14.729
Mary Harrington: Yeah, and if we're able to accept that in principle for a… you know, we started this conversation talking about translation between media, and I think… I think that's very much the subject that we're talking about here, if we're talking about

196
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:17.090
Mary Harrington: A translation between

197
00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:37.030
Mary Harrington: between information technologies. It seems… it seems logical to me that we should be able to apply the same level of critical reflection to what's happening in that sense, and in this field, and not make it either into some sort of dumb culture war thing, or a sort of tech doomerism, or…

198
00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:46.119
Mary Harrington: I… well, or indeed a sort of reckless running in… rushing into the future without… without any care or attentiveness to the treasures that we already have.

199
00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:52.319
Eugene Callahan: Yeah, I find, in my writing and editing, I always finish on paper.

200
00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:59.030
Eugene Callahan: My last couple of edits, you know, at some point, I have to get off the screen to really read the piece.

201
00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:08.239
Mary Harrington: Yeah, I don't… I don't do that… I don't do that for short pieces anymore. But I think that's… that's more a function of time.

202
00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:20.630
Mary Harrington: Than anything else, but… but any time… the last few times I've written anything long form, yeah, absolutely. And certainly, when it comes down to proofing a book, there's no other way around it. Yeah, you go down a red pen and a ruler, there's no other way.

203
00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:29.650
Eugene Callahan: Yeah, right, so… What political form, and, you know, here we're getting very speculative, so if,

204
00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:35.609
Eugene Callahan: Liberal democracy was the political form appropriate to the age of print.

205
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:38.939
Eugene Callahan: You have any speculation as to what

206
00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:42.839
Eugene Callahan: Form is going to be appropriate for our post-literary age?

207
00:29:43.760 --> 00:30:02.819
Mary Harrington: I don't know, and I'm hesitant to… to be too concrete, because I think this is the sort of thing which can… which can land quite differently according to local cultural conditions, but it seems plausible to me that a genuinely post-liberal politics will be more autocratic in some

208
00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:04.530
Mary Harrington: Form, or other.

209
00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:23.710
Mary Harrington: And I think you could… you can probably make the case. I mean, you know, several foreign policy publications have recently, in fact, made the case that that's actually already happening. You know, it doesn't take me over here, kind of, being a prophet of doom to note that the world seems recently to have been carved up between three

210
00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:29.079
Mary Harrington: Three very post-liberal-seeming, sphere of inference guys.

211
00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:30.770
Mary Harrington: Yep.

212
00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:40.070
Mary Harrington: None of which is based… not one of which is based in the United Kingdom. But, you know, this is… this is the considered and not particularly delighted view of

213
00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:52.779
Mary Harrington: serious people in the foreign policy world, that this is… that… that sort of eruption of something… something that… something very much more imperious and imperial is already upon us.

214
00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:54.530
Eugene Callahan: That's when my number…

215
00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:55.120
Mary Harrington: Bye.

216
00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:56.190
Eugene Callahan: In my notes.

217
00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:57.939
Mary Harrington: I mean, what… go on.

218
00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:02.220
Eugene Callahan: when I, I said imperial form, so.

219
00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:08.320
Mary Harrington: Yeah, I mean, I think… I think… I think the nation-state has had it, but I think we… but I also think we already knew that.

220
00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:10.399
Mary Harrington: I mean, the… the…

221
00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:26.009
Mary Harrington: It's only… it's only normal voters who still think we have nation-states, or have been acting as if we still have nation-states since the Second World War. You know, the guys who are in a position to actually decide anything have been acting as if that needs to be bypassed.

222
00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:37.679
Mary Harrington: As much as possible for a very long time. And I think, you know, that all happened with… with the best of intentions, and, you know, this isn't some sort of sinister plot, lest you be tempted to depict me as a tinfoil hatter, I'm not.

223
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:51.119
Mary Harrington: You know, this is… you know, with the best will in the world, there are a lot of people who are very worried that if we ended up with nation-states again, then they'd end up with national wars again, and then everybody else… millions more would have to die like they did in the First and Second World Wars.

224
00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:59.059
Mary Harrington: Yeah, nobody, nobody wants that. So, you know, let's have… let's have something transnational and post-national instead, and we'll have international, universal

225
00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:11.639
Mary Harrington: systems of governance, and it'll all be much more cooperative and collaborative and sensible and rational, and we won't do any more fighting. I don't know. I'm not sure that that's really worked out, but that was… that was the… the sort of… that was the hope.

226
00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:22.649
Mary Harrington: So we've got this sort of… we've got this sort of strange kind of pantomime… we've got pantomime horse, so you don't have pantomime horses in America, do you? That's a… that's a… that's not a helpful metaphor.

227
00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:25.120
Eugene Callahan: I've only… I've been to a painting.

228
00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:43.179
Mary Harrington: Okay, oh yeah, that's right, that's right, you have RF relatives. These strange sort of chimeric, political order, where half of, you know, about half of the people in charge want it to be transnational or postnational, and the other half are determined that it shouldn't be, so nobody can really get anything done.

229
00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:44.870
Mary Harrington: And…

230
00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:56.649
Mary Harrington: But I think, I mean, sometimes when I… when I'm in my grumpier moods, I think, well, you know, maybe the post-nationals are sort of directionally right in some sense.

231
00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:03.519
Mary Harrington: In… and… and I mean, here… here I come back again to my Vegas, to my rather sort of Marshall McLuhan-ish,

232
00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:06.240
Mary Harrington: Speculations about the end of the print era.

233
00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:12.940
Mary Harrington: I mean, McLuhan's not the only one. The number of people, I think, persuasion.

234
00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:14.940
Mary Harrington: Make the case, but…

235
00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:30.600
Mary Harrington: the printing press and the nation-state are… are coexpensive in terms of their emergence. Yeah, I mean, I did a hopeless job of summarizing all of the ways in which print changed the world, but one of the ways print changed the world was helping to create the nation-state as a political form.

236
00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:35.459
Mary Harrington: In the sense that, you know, it helped to kill off Latin as a lingua franca.

237
00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:38.719
Mary Harrington: and to consolidate these.

238
00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:46.099
Mary Harrington: These polities, which hadn't really existed before, of reading… of people's reading in… in a vernacular.

239
00:33:46.400 --> 00:34:02.629
Mary Harrington: And it's only once you have that, that larger reading public, speaking of vernaculum, that you can begin to create the, you know, what Benedict Anderson calls the imagined community, which is the, the sort of the political enabling condition for the nation-state as a political form.

240
00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:06.380
Mary Harrington: and…

241
00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:23.389
Mary Harrington: when you… when you run that scenario in reverse, I mean, I don't really like any of the outcomes that you could potentially come… end up with at the end of that. But, I mean, you know, sort of possible… possible ways that that could shake down might be, you know, you say, well, what does it look like if the nation-state comes apart into its nation?

242
00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:27.489
Mary Harrington: component. I mean, by nation, I mean in the Old Testament sense.

243
00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:29.700
Mary Harrington: And states.

244
00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:37.420
Mary Harrington: Because it's, you know, it's historic… it's obviously historically the case that nation and state didn't… haven't always coincided. In fact.

245
00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:54.210
Mary Harrington: there's something peculiarly modern about that. So what does it look like if those… if those components come apart? I don't know, I think it probably does look like some… some form of, you know… I mean, that's what the Habsburg Empire was, right? That was a… it was a state… a state comprised… comprising multiple nations.

246
00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:55.159
Eugene Callahan: Yep.

247
00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:58.749
Mary Harrington: You know, what… what does that…

248
00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:01.420
Mary Harrington: What does that look like within…

249
00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:11.960
Mary Harrington: polities, you know, how does that shake down within policies that are currently assembled as nation-states? I don't know. I don't really… I don't really want to think about it in very much detail, because it's…

250
00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:25.560
Mary Harrington: there's sort of no scenario there, which isn't just kind of… which isn't quite ugly, at least, until everything settles down again. You know, I don't like any of those possibilities, but then I also… this isn't… this isn't a point I made, this is…

251
00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:34.549
Mary Harrington: I forget who, but it was probably sort of someone on the internet, pointed out again, I think, persuasively, that once you have, constant

252
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:37.090
Mary Harrington: transnational connectivity.

253
00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:51.200
Mary Harrington: that, for example, the idea of people, integrating, migrants integrating, is basically… is fundamentally a non-starter, because whereas… whereas, for example, when… when people left to go and settle in Australia.

254
00:35:51.200 --> 00:36:09.000
Mary Harrington: moved halfway around the world 100 years ago, you basically said goodbye to your family, and you might never see them again. So you sort of have to fit in wherever it is that you find yourself. But when you can just be constantly Bluetooth to whoever it is that you're still friends with back home, I mean, in theory, you just don't really need to be where you are at all.

255
00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:13.820
Mary Harrington: Except maybe in a sort of very thinly, kind of, economic sense.

256
00:36:14.290 --> 00:36:20.010
Mary Harrington: Or perhaps a, perhaps a sort of equally, equally thinly sort of administrative one.

257
00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:30.140
Mary Harrington: But in terms of the kind of presence which is denoted by actual integration, you sort of don't really need to. You know, you might want to, but you don't have to.

258
00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:32.739
Mary Harrington: So, yeah.

259
00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:34.550
Eugene Callahan: Neil Stevenson, and I

260
00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:40.620
Eugene Callahan: don't remember if this was more in Snow Crash or Diamond Age, but one of his novels

261
00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:48.019
Eugene Callahan: He depicts what are, non-geographic polities interacting all over the world, where,

262
00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:55.390
Eugene Callahan: Your polity is like a guild you belong to, and they'll step in and defend you against…

263
00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:59.880
Eugene Callahan: you know, aggression from other polities. It's kind of a…

264
00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:03.660
Eugene Callahan: Interesting speculation on what might be coming.

265
00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:19.440
Mary Harrington: It's an interesting speculation, although, I mean, I'd probably… I'd probably want to set that against the IR maxim that geography is destiny. There's a… there's a sense in which, you know, you can be… you… you can be a… I mean, this is… that idea is sort of…

266
00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:35.070
Mary Harrington: been… it's kicked around more recently in the tech communities, hasn't it, in the form of network states? And the question which I have yet to see answered, at least openly, I'm sure they talk about it privately amongst themselves, is what hard power looks like in a network state.

267
00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:40.959
Mary Harrington: You know, who manufactures the weapons? Who defends the supply lines? Who's making the food?

268
00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:47.460
Mary Harrington: And if you just… if you're just gonna wave your arms and say, oh, it's all robots, I'm like, okay, well, who's guarding the power stations? And with what?

269
00:37:47.720 --> 00:38:05.629
Mary Harrington: You know, because the question, you and… you and whose army is bound to… is bound to emerge sooner or later? I mean, at least… at least if you… if you have a fairly tragic, view of human nature, you're expecting it to emerge sooner or later, right?

270
00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:06.460
Eugene Callahan: That's right.

271
00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:07.500
Eugene Callahan: I've gone.

272
00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:14.820
Mary Harrington: But just to… just to complete that thought about, dispersed communities interacting all the way around the world.

273
00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:27.949
Mary Harrington: When we think about nations and states coming apart, I think the most depressing version of that scenario is just ethnic fragmenta… ethnic balkanization within what were previously homogenous nation-states.

274
00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:40.980
Mary Harrington: governed by some sort of thinner, thinner kind of supranational, approach to management. I don't really know what. And then balkanizing along very much more tribalized lines. I mean, this is…

275
00:38:41.930 --> 00:39:00.580
Mary Harrington: You know, there are… there are doomsayers who sort of warn that that's already happening in some European countries. You know, for example, people talk about no-go zones in some Swedish cities. I don't… you know, and it's very hard to tell, isn't it, when you, you look at reports like that, because whoever it is who produces a report like that has always got an axe to grind.

276
00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:08.429
Mary Harrington: And you sort of… you feel like you just want… you need to take everything with a bit of a pinch of salt. But there does seem… there does seem to be…

277
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:13.579
Mary Harrington: A certain sort of geographic… an effect of geographic clustering.

278
00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:21.419
Mary Harrington: along, a long trib… a sort of re-tribalization occurring, I think, if you like.

279
00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:36.200
Mary Harrington: You know, within even polities that had explicitly embraced a version of modernity, which disavowed tribalism as such as being a thing of the past. I don't think it's a thing of the past, or at least it was a thing of the past, I have a horrible feeling it will be a thing of the future again.

280
00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:43.930
Mary Harrington: As well. I don't love that outcome. I don't love that story, but I think that's… I think that's part of what nation-states coming apart looks like.

281
00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:51.389
Mary Harrington: So, you know, you can make… you can paint a gloomy picture about the end of liberal democracy, but I think, the more… the more alarming

282
00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:54.540
Mary Harrington: Side of that story is retribualization.

283
00:39:55.250 --> 00:40:03.500
Eugene Callahan: I'm actually meant to start, introduce this at the beginning, but before we run out of time,

284
00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:08.230
Eugene Callahan: Can you tell us, give us a sneak preview of your new book?

285
00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:27.370
Mary Harrington: I mean, this is kind of what we've been talking about, it's the whole thing. The title is The King and the Swan, and the one-liner is Politics After the Singularity, and my thesis being that the singularity already happened, and in fact, it was just the point where we… where the smartphone went… became pervasive.

286
00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:37.689
Mary Harrington: But also, also, this isn't the first singularity. You know, we merged with our information technologies once before, with a printing press.

287
00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:45.870
Mary Harrington: And then the pro… and then… and that… but even that wasn't the first singularity, because before that, we merged with our information technologies when we invented the Greek alphabet.

288
00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:51.309
Mary Harrington: And so it's… I'm tracing the… the development, particularly of European Western

289
00:40:51.390 --> 00:41:10.799
Mary Harrington: cultures from the inception of the alphabet through these two earlier singularities of the invention of literacy, and then the invention of the printing press, and then setting some of the developments of the digital age in the context of those developments to tease out some of the pros and cons.

290
00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:16.459
Eugene Callahan: Is there a reason you're focusing on the Greek alphabet? Is there something…

291
00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:21.719
Eugene Callahan: So the Phoenicians had an alphabet, and the Hebrews adopted that, and.

292
00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:22.989
Mary Harrington: I mean, the…

293
00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:35.479
Mary Harrington: The Phoenician one was the one that turned into the Greek alphabet. I mean, the significance of the Greek alphabet was that that was the point where all the sounds, pretty much, were… had their own symbols.

294
00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:42.549
Mary Harrington: Right, okay. Yes, yes, I mean, the Jewish people had an alphabet for consider… had a script for considerably longer than that.

295
00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:59.069
Mary Harrington: Which is, I mean, you know, the Jewish history of scriptural study and deep literacy is thousands of years old. So, you know, I'm not… I'm certainly not… certainly not kind of ignoring that. You know, it's not as though there aren't other scripts, but they're…

296
00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:01.040
Mary Harrington: But the…

297
00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:12.870
Mary Harrington: the significance of the Greek alphabet is that it's… it symbolizes… it represents all of the symbols, whereas I think… I think you need the little dots, don't you, in the Semitic script?

298
00:42:14.570 --> 00:42:14.960
Eugene Callahan: Yes.

299
00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:20.660
Mary Harrington: And some… and some of the older… some of the older texts don't have the little dots, and you just have to know, and if you know, you know, and if not, then good luck.

300
00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:28.279
Eugene Callahan: Yes, good. Okay, that's what I was curious about. So,

301
00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:39.550
Eugene Callahan: I'm looking over my list now. You… you made a point about the, European states

302
00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:47.320
Eugene Callahan: attempting to, show that they were ready to stand up to Trump over Greenland and stand up to Russia.

303
00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:50.819
Eugene Callahan: And, you had a picture of the big heart attack.

304
00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:51.250
Mary Harrington: I'm not…

305
00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:53.540
Eugene Callahan: NATO guy.

306
00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:58.439
Mary Harrington: So, sorry, what are you referencing here? I'm just trying to… just trying to…

307
00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:03.630
Eugene Callahan: Yeah, well, you know, I didn't know which, which…

308
00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:06.550
Mary Harrington: essay it was, but you were talking about.

309
00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:08.790
Eugene Callahan: There was a B-Cardigan NATO guy.

310
00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:10.269
Mary Harrington: Oh, yes.

311
00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:27.729
Eugene Callahan: who was saying, we're gonna stand up to Trump over Greenland, and we'll take on Russia, and you know, I looked at the picture, and I said, well, you know, if I wanted to say what threat this guy would represent, I'd say, well, he's probably a threat to maybe steal your organic bran muffins.

312
00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:32.260
Eugene Callahan: But… but not really to fight Russia.

313
00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:37.210
Eugene Callahan: And, So…

314
00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:47.409
Eugene Callahan: I had a quote from Machiavelli, there can be… there cannot be good laws where there are not good arms, and where there are good arms, there must be good laws.

315
00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:50.850
Eugene Callahan: So, what do you see,

316
00:43:51.690 --> 00:44:00.019
Eugene Callahan: I mean, I think your view that the states in Western Europe are American protectorates is accurate. It's,

317
00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:07.340
Eugene Callahan: And, you know, the Trump administration may be trying to, break that relationship.

318
00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:19.010
Mary Harrington: outer space who counted the number of American bases in… come on, Sophie. I think anyone from another planet who counted the number of American military bases in Europe,

319
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:23.209
Mary Harrington: Would… would draw the conclusion that this was an occupation.

320
00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:24.230
Eugene Callahan: Yes.

321
00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:30.009
Mary Harrington: You know, which… You know, there's obviously… the relationship has more to it than that.

322
00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:33.259
Mary Harrington: The relationship is far more complex than that.

323
00:44:33.490 --> 00:44:41.009
Mary Harrington: You know, some of my best friends are American, etc, and so on. Yeah, I… I spend a lot of time in the United States.

324
00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:55.660
Mary Harrington: The relationship is complicated, but it's… I think it's… I think it's basically accurate that the European states are American protectors, and… and there's a… there's a great deal of ambivalence about that. I… it's… it's not really clear to me.

325
00:44:55.730 --> 00:45:03.670
Mary Harrington: how all of that is going to shake down. How… I mean, a lot of it… a lot of it depends on who comes after Trump, doesn't it?

326
00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:12.150
Mary Harrington: Because, I mean, you've got 3 more years of him, and, I mean, based… based on how it's gone so far, pretty much anything could happen over that time.

327
00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:13.360
Eugene Callahan: Yeah.

328
00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:19.149
Mary Harrington: But nobody really knows who or what comes next.

329
00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:25.899
Eugene Callahan: But being inside an empire is a mixed bag.

330
00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:37.689
Eugene Callahan: But, if you look at the Roman Empire, the invading Germans were not invading for the most part because they wanted to defeat the empire, they were invading because they wanted to live inside it.

331
00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:38.880
Mary Harrington: That's right.

332
00:45:39.650 --> 00:45:47.760
Mary Harrington: That's right. I mean, this is… this is a… this is a well-known… a well-known pathway for MPARTS, if I'm… if I… if I…

333
00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:49.569
Mary Harrington: Remember rightly.

334
00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:50.090
Eugene Callahan: Yep.

335
00:45:50.090 --> 00:45:52.500
Mary Harrington: And some things… many such cases.

336
00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:59.780
Eugene Callahan: Yes. Okay, so,

337
00:46:00.490 --> 00:46:05.279
Eugene Callahan: We'll try to… I've got a bunch of more notes, we'll try to,

338
00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:11.870
Eugene Callahan: wrap things up soon. I don't like to go over an hour, just because I feel, you know, it becomes…

339
00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:17.309
Eugene Callahan: tiring. So you wrote about, Helen Andrews.

340
00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:20.629
Eugene Callahan: Wrote an essay on the feminization of work.

341
00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:28.539
Eugene Callahan: And you feel she missed some points there. Can you, describe what her essay misses.

342
00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:41.450
Mary Harrington: Oh, this is… I mean, my… when I wrote Feminism Against Progress, it was about the emergence of the women's movement, and it touched on some of the same themes that Helen hits in that essay.

343
00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:49.910
Mary Harrington: To do with the emergence, particularly, of a very… a very strong female representation in certain kinds of knowledge… knowledge work.

344
00:46:49.910 --> 00:47:02.180
Mary Harrington: Particularly across, you know, bureaucratic, the kinds of moral, disciplinary, educational, and moral conditioning-type work that used to be done by church ladies in the 90s.

345
00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:15.250
Eugene Callahan: You cut out again, At church ladies who cut out So, Mary?

346
00:47:17.110 --> 00:47:18.080
Eugene Callahan: Mary?

347
00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:22.900
Eugene Callahan: Mary.

348
00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:27.100
Eugene Callahan: Mary.

349
00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:33.230
Eugene Callahan: Mary?

350
00:47:34.410 --> 00:47:36.690
Mary Harrington: century for… for free. Nugget.

351
00:47:37.370 --> 00:47:39.879
Eugene Callahan: Okay, you're cutting it and out.

352
00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:51.620
Mary Harrington: Oh, you couldn't hear me now.

353
00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:53.170
Eugene Callahan: Yes, that's good.

354
00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:53.800
Mary Harrington: Oh.

355
00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:57.569
Eugene Callahan: So, you cut out, you said, about church ladies. So, church ladies.

356
00:47:57.570 --> 00:47:59.350
Mary Harrington: Just the…

357
00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:11.459
Mary Harrington: Yeah, church ladies used to do this work in the 19th century, and now in the 20th century, it's done… 20th and 21st, it's done by HR ladies, who are functionally the same… they're the same class and type of person as… as the church…

358
00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:13.809
Mary Harrington: Money now instead of for free.

359
00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:16.030
Eugene Callahan: But I mean, Helen's…

360
00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:26.460
Eugene Callahan: I'm sorry, you cut out again.

361
00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:38.090
Mary Harrington: something, something Joyce Benson, is a civilizational catastrophe, and therefore, what… all we really need to do is take the thumb off the scales, and hopefully things will go back to normal. Which, maybe.

362
00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:49.400
Mary Harrington: But I'm… I don't… I'm not… I'm not completely convinced by that argument, because I think what it misses out is the, is, again, the effects of technology as a form.

363
00:48:50.210 --> 00:48:52.300
Mary Harrington: The effects of our…

364
00:48:53.760 --> 00:49:13.660
Mary Harrington: the formal effects of our overall civilization environment. And I think it's… I think it's just a mistake to attribute, quote-unquote, the great feminization entirely to women, because I think some of it is…

365
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:21.910
Mary Harrington: It's a byproduct of our environment. And I don't just mean this in a sense.

366
00:49:25.950 --> 00:49:26.580
Eugene Callahan: Hmm.

367
00:49:26.690 --> 00:49:27.630
Eugene Callahan: Okay.

368
00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:35.640
Mary Harrington: of, you know, chemicals in the water, doing things to the amphibious life, as Alex Jones notoriously…

369
00:49:38.690 --> 00:49:43.609
Eugene Callahan: Okay. Well, I want to take this… you're… you've begun cutting out…

370
00:49:43.610 --> 00:49:46.679
Mary Harrington: I mean, in the sense that she characterizes as being feminine ones.

371
00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:47.769
Mary Harrington: Can you hear me?

372
00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:56.360
Mary Harrington: To give you an example, well, I mean, if you, if you take one of the, one of the most frequently cited, sexed differences,

373
00:49:57.660 --> 00:50:00.430
Mary Harrington: Just a moment, I'm gonna go upstairs, and I'm… I'm gonna…

374
00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:03.560
Mary Harrington: Can you hear me now? Yep. How about now? Can you hear me now?

375
00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:04.160
Eugene Callahan: Yep.

376
00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:07.890
Eugene Callahan: Not now.

377
00:50:14.530 --> 00:50:17.349
Mary Harrington: Right, so, I'm not sure… hey, can you hear me?

378
00:50:17.590 --> 00:50:18.780
Eugene Callahan: Yeah, now I can…

379
00:50:19.170 --> 00:50:25.630
Mary Harrington: Yeah, I'm about 3 feet from the router, so it should work now. The… I think the…

380
00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:45.660
Mary Harrington: you know, Helen's… Helen's argument is that what we need to do is take our thumb off the scales and civilization will correct itself, which may be, but I feel like what that misses out is the… I just think it's a mistake to attribute feminization, as she characterizes it, purely to women, which… it sounds like a crazy argument to make.

381
00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:56.140
Mary Harrington: But let me give you an example. I mean, one of the most commonly cited sexed differences, normatively, on average, is between male and female typical styles of conflict.

382
00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:58.949
Mary Harrington: Men, reportedly.

383
00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:05.619
Mary Harrington: I mean, men are more physically violent than women. Men tend to form in-groups and compete with other in-groups.

384
00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:20.510
Mary Harrington: In social forms which have a clear hierarchy, women tend to have more flat, diffuse social structures, and to conduct their interpersonal conflicts indirectly through social means, such as ostracism, or dogpiling, or what have you.

385
00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:30.089
Mary Harrington: So I don't know if you've ever watched a group of young, predominantly, or perhaps exclusively male, right-winger noms, having an argument on the internet.

386
00:51:30.090 --> 00:51:43.629
Mary Harrington: I mean, if you think about… if you think about what the internet does as a form, what it does is it incentivizes endless talking, ostracism, backbiting, dogpiling, and so on, and it forecloses actual physical violence.

387
00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:56.430
Mary Harrington: So, as a form, it forces everybody into… into a social… into a social performance which is indistinguishable from what… what a social… what Joyce Bennison characterizes as feminization.

388
00:51:56.430 --> 00:52:21.269
Mary Harrington: You know, the internet is actually feminizing everybody. Social media is an incredibly feminizing technology. I mean, this is a million… this is a long way from being the only phenomenon which… which contributes to this kind of subtle pervasive social shift. I mean, if you think about the transition of work away from arduous manual labor of the kind that privileges men towards the more flat-structured, socially-based.

389
00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:27.769
Mary Harrington: skills, promoting, managerial-type work, which very much more advantages women.

390
00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:39.560
Mary Harrington: And you think, well, is it all… is it all down to some malign attribute of women that, people are attending more to exhibit, feminine styles of behaviour?

391
00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:44.780
Mary Harrington: I'm… I'm not convinced. I mean, sure, you know.

392
00:52:45.010 --> 00:52:50.330
Mary Harrington: You know, you can… you can cite… you can cite statistics, and you're blue in the face about the…

393
00:52:50.410 --> 00:53:06.629
Mary Harrington: about the increased presence of women in the workforce, but most of the trends which… most of the social patterns which come under the… which are… which are decried under the heading of feminization and blamed on women started long before the women were in the workforce in any numbers at all.

394
00:53:06.630 --> 00:53:21.799
Mary Harrington: So I think there's just a really important counterfactual that needs to be made from the overall sociocultural effects of our prevailing material environment, and the social forms that it produces, that really just needs to be offset quite carefully.

395
00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:28.250
Mary Harrington: Against, sort of, large, sort of, large-scale hand-waving, all of which just cashes out as we need to kick women out of the workforce.

396
00:53:28.250 --> 00:53:32.839
Mary Harrington: Because to me, that just seems… that just seems stupid.

397
00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:37.840
Mary Harrington: And fundamentally mistaken. I mean, I guess I would say that, wouldn't I?

398
00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:54.940
Mary Harrington: But even so, I think I've… I can… I can make the case for it much… I can make the case for why that would be… that it's the wrong… it's the wrong solution, you know what I mean, you… I don't… I don't particularly love cancel culture, right? But I… but I don't think… I don't think it would go away if you remove women from the workforce, I really don't.

399
00:53:54.940 --> 00:54:00.969
Mary Harrington: Not unless you also changed, fundamentally, a number of other salient features of the prevailing culture.

400
00:54:01.850 --> 00:54:06.670
Eugene Callahan: All right, let's end up on… we'll end up on a very gloomy note.

401
00:54:06.670 --> 00:54:09.599
Mary Harrington: Huh. Do we have to? Yes.

402
00:54:10.270 --> 00:54:18.720
Eugene Callahan: So, Feminism Against Progress, it's been a few years since I've read it, but as I recall, one of the main things is that

403
00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:26.400
Eugene Callahan: Progress towards market dominance of the economy has been to make people interchangeable.

404
00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:27.600
Eugene Callahan: Right?

405
00:54:27.870 --> 00:54:45.070
Eugene Callahan: You want to, you want to flatten any differences between men and women, because you want them as cogs in the machine of production. And I was just, reading a paper on Hannah Arendt, where she says that,

406
00:54:45.530 --> 00:54:55.799
Eugene Callahan: One of the characteristics of totalitarianism is that it wants to flatten all differences and make people as interchangeable as possible.

407
00:54:55.950 --> 00:55:06.339
Eugene Callahan: And this raises the, you know, what for my libertarian friends would be impossible, the specter of totalitarian capitalism.

408
00:55:06.530 --> 00:55:20.670
Eugene Callahan: Where, you know, everyone has just been, reduced to a cog in a great machine of production, except for the, you know, the few people on top running it.

409
00:55:21.690 --> 00:55:29.759
Eugene Callahan: So, this, I don't know, this picture came to me as I was reading this paper and prepping for this interview.

410
00:55:30.290 --> 00:55:37.220
Eugene Callahan: anything… Strike you, you know, looking at things, looking at that idea?

411
00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:54.729
Mary Harrington: I don't know, I mean, I think the most likely countervailing force against an outcome like that is probably one which would be, in effect, just as depressing, which is to say the oncoming tidal wave of demographic and cognitive collapse.

412
00:55:54.880 --> 00:56:12.819
Mary Harrington: I'm not sure… I'm not sure which version of catastrophe we're going to get first, maybe we'll get both at once. You know, on the one, we seem… we seem to be sort of on a… on a trajectory towards what you characterize as totalitarian capitalism, but then we also… I mean, populations are imploding to as-yet-unknown effect.

413
00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:27.890
Mary Harrington: And also, the cognitive transformations affected by post-literacy are also driving so rapid a decline in people's ability to think rationally. Which, I mean, if you think about it for even a moment, you'll agree it's just visible everywhere.

414
00:56:27.890 --> 00:56:38.790
Mary Harrington: You know, it's driving… it's driving a competence crisis across all of the technical and engineering skills that we need to just keep everything that we already have functioning, let alone, I don't know, make it into space or whatever.

415
00:56:38.790 --> 00:56:54.900
Mary Harrington: You know, with potholes appearing in the roads, and, you know, and electricity substations spontaneously catching fire, and planes and windows falling out of airplanes, and air traffic control systems going kaput every 5 or 10 minutes.

416
00:56:54.900 --> 00:57:07.490
Mary Harrington: You think… I mean, does… is that… is… I'm not sure… I'm not sure how long that's compatible with the sort of dark, dystopian, or hyper-efficient image of totalitarian capitalism.

417
00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:07.910
Eugene Callahan: Brilla?

418
00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:26.910
Mary Harrington: I mean, you know, a nightmare future where you somehow get both of those feels like, you know, it might be… it might be sustainable for a bit, but eventually, eventually the sheer force of numptiness is gonna… is gonna sink your Gattaca dystopia, right? Just because people can't keep the lights on.

419
00:57:27.130 --> 00:57:43.640
Mary Harrington: Yeah. So, I mean, you know, it's not a particularly cheery, it's not a particularly cheery argument, but stance of skepticism towards totalitarian capitalism. But I'm… I don't know, I just think… I just think people are too… people are too human.

420
00:57:43.780 --> 00:58:00.260
Mary Harrington: to… to allow that to happen. People will just… it won't happen, because people will just be like, oh, I can't be bothered, or they'll… they'll forget to take the… they'll forget to turn the gas off, or… Yeah, people are… people are kind of… people are too human. It's never going to get that efficient. I just don't buy it.

421
00:58:00.650 --> 00:58:10.850
Eugene Callahan: Well, I think, what we can do is, when this is, published, we can send all the readers a bottle of antidepressants to go along with,

422
00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:16.090
Mary Harrington: I mean, just to put a slightly… a slightly more positive gloss.

423
00:58:16.090 --> 00:58:40.059
Mary Harrington: on what I just said. Well, actually, now I've done… now that I say it, I realize it isn't a more positive gloss. But there are… I mean, you know, just to finish on an even more miserable note, there are times when I… when I look at the… I look at the fertility crisis, and I think, no, that's actually just nature. That's nature taking its course. That's nature self-correcting. This is a… this is a culture which is obviously so… so comprehensively, organismically intolerable.

424
00:58:40.060 --> 00:58:42.179
Mary Harrington: That people have just stopped having kids in it.

425
00:58:42.450 --> 00:58:48.400
Mary Harrington: And it will therefore, you know, eventually, over several generations, it will self-correct.

426
00:58:48.720 --> 00:59:01.770
Mary Harrington: And something… something will come out which won't be either, sort of, either version of the dystopia which I just painted. And I think it'll probably be a bumpy ride getting there, but I think we will get there, and we'll remain human, whether we want to or not.

427
00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:21.699
Eugene Callahan: Yes, well, very good. It's been very interesting. I don't want to take up any more of your time. And what we'll do is, parts that cut out, I'll… I'll send to you, you know, where it stopped and where it began again, and you can, from memory… from your memory palace, fill in what you can.

428
00:59:22.690 --> 00:59:24.200
Mary Harrington: Heh, I'll do my best.

429
00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:25.719
Eugene Callahan: Alright, thanks so much for your time.

430
00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:30.779
Mary Harrington: It's been… No, it's great to speak to you, Eugene. Sorry about the sketchy network.

431
00:59:30.780 --> 00:59:32.609
Eugene Callahan: Yeah, no worries. Alright, take care.

432
00:59:32.610 --> 00:59:33.420
Mary Harrington: Speak later.
