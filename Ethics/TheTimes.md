# The Times Can't Tell Us What We Should Do


I was watching an episode of *Blue Bloods* the other day, that long-running police show starring Tom Selleck as Police
Comissioner Frank Reagan. In that episode, Frank was talking to his friend, the archbishop of New York. He informed the
archbishop that the Catholic Church had "fallen behind the times" on the topic of homosexual conduct.

In a very similar but real incident,
an angry name-caller on x.com informed me that I am a "homophobe" because I didn't approve of Sam Altman's surrogacy
arrangement to acquire a child. When I told him I objected to surrogacy for heterosexual couples as well,
he told me I was "out of touch" and blocked me.

Another phrase expressing this same idea is that one's opponents ideas are on ["the wrong side of
history."](https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/6284/wrong-side-of-history). For instance, Google's recent changes to its
[AI principles](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/02/google-wrong-side-history) are on the wrong side of history, and
[President Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/opinion/trump-dei-meritocracy-civil-right.html) is *deliberately* on
the wrong side of history.
[Germany](https://arabcenterdc.org/resource/once-again-germany-is-on-the-wrong-side-of-history/) is on the wrong side of
history for its support of Israel, and, in his second appearance in this essay, [Sam
Altman](https://youtu.be/3DEPDN8oD0w?si=6Tgn8v6wzXr0Cysb) has declared that OpenAI has been on the wrong side of history
regarding open source software.

Yet another common version of this genre of argument simply states the current year or century, as though that alone should
make obvious which side is right in an ethical debate.
For example, Katha Pollit of *The Nation* entitled a talk she gave ""What?! It's the 21st Century and We're Still
Fighting for Reproductive Rights?" (I wonder if someone gave a talk in 1240 entitled, ""What?! It's the 13th Century and
We're Still Fighting About Whether Trial by Ordeal Works?")
You can even buy gay-pride t-shirts for toddlers emblazoned with a pride rainbow and the words ["Hello,
It's the 21st
Century"](https://www.threadless.com/shop/%40stineiva/design/hello-its-the-21st-century-pride/kids/toddler-t-shirt), as
though just mentioning the current century could determine sexual ethics.
It is noteworthy that this was recognized as a fallacious argument over 2000 years ago, as
the (*argumentum ad annum*)[https://www.newoxfordreview.org/documents/is-the-natural-law-still-natural/], or argument
from the year.

All of these arguments share the same premise: if what Alfred North Whitehead, in *Science and the Modern World*,
called "the climate of opinion" favors some practice, but
you are against it, you are obviously wrong. There is no need to even address any substantive argument you might make
suggesting that the climate of opinion looks like bad weather.

Aside from the silliness of such a method of evaluating moral arguments, it also displays a profound ignorance of how
the winds in the climate of opinion have sometimes blown this way, and sometimes that.

For example, the climate of opinion over the course of the Middle Ages increasingly rejected slavery as a valid human
institution. But with the onset of the age of discovery and the profits offered by the
slave trade, the climate of opinion became much more accepting of slavery. We can easily imagine a southern plantation
owner in 1820 answering an abolitionist by pointing out how "out of touch" the abolitionist position was.

Similarly, Christianity had promoted the idea that all people are equally God's children, and thus equally deserving of
the same respect and rights. (And Buddhism and Islam promoted similar views.)
But the rise of social Darwinism and eugenics in the late 19th century saw such views
as antiquated, and not in keeping with "the times," since "modern biology" had refuted them. Numerous "progressives"
in the early 20th century, such as [Woodrow Wilson and Margaret
Sanger](https://www.independent.org/news/article.asp?id=13217),
thought that it was important to stop "inferior races" from breeding and weakening the genetic
stock of the human race.

In the 17th century, the absolute monarchies of Spain, and France appeared to be the "modern" model of how a state
should be organized. Charles I of England believed that he was keeping up with "the times" by trying to establish such a
regime in England.

In Germany, as Wikipedia tells us, "From the time of Moses Mendelssohn until the 20th century, the [Jewish] community
gradually achieved emancipation, and then prospered." But by 1935, if you wanted to keep up with "the times," you had to
believe that that was all a big mistake, and that Jews were alien parasites who had to be ejected from the body politic.
Millions of Germans, who probably personally bore no animosity towards their Jewish neighbors, went along with this,
because they did not want to be "out of touch."

The great German philosopher G.W.F. Hegel thought that Napoleon's conquests in Europe represented the "world spirit"
advancing in time, but "the times" defeated Napoleon and sent him into exile. In the Soviet Union, private property was
understood to be a "phase" that the U.S.S.R. was advancing beyond. And in Pol Pot's Cambodia, "the times" demanded the
mass killing of intellectuals, ethnic minorities, Cambodian Christians, and Buddhist monks.

So how do people maintain the illusion that "the times" are on their side, and people who disagree with them are "out of
touch," when history offers so many counter examples to the times always being correct?

Often, they do so by embracing an error in historical thinking that Michael Oakeshott pointed out many years ago, that of splitting
history into "the course of events," and "interventions (or interruptions) in the course of events."

For instance, for someone who sees liberal capitalism as what "the times" tell us is the "right side of history" (e.g.,
Francis Fukuyama), then
the fall of the Soviet Union was part of "the course of events." But the Iranian Revolution, or the current rise of
populist parties, are ""interventions in the course of events."

Meanwhile, a committed Marxist would view the rise of the Soviet Union as part of "the course of events," but its fall
as an interruption in that course.

As Oakeshott pointed out, this is historical nonsense. As he put it, "The Pope's intervention did not change the course
of events, it *was* the course of events." (*Rationalism in Politics*, "The activity of being an historian.")

The Iranian revolution or the current rise of populist parties *are* the course of events. These things are simply turns
in the course of events that the person declaring them "interventions" does not like.

If we place all movements towards a state of affairs we prefer in the course of events, and place any counter
movement (no matter how large) into the category of "interruptions in the course of events," then we can always conclude
that history is moving towards our preferred state of affairs, despite the fact that history seeminngly
gets interrupted as frequently as President Trump addressing Democratic congressmen. You just assume that
your side's victories are the road that history is traveling, while your defeats are just bumps in that
road.

To be fair, there are times when the argument from the year actually works. For instance, in a subject that makes steady
technical progress, it can be quite reasonable to say something like "come on, it's 2024, we can't explain forest fires
using phlogiston theory." No one today should be declaring that flies spontaneously generate in rotting meat, even
though that was a reasonable hypothesis 200 years ago.

And this is where the use of this argument in condemning moral or policy choices gets its spurious plausibility:
it is a faulty analogy with a field like physics or chemistry, in which is clear when progress is being made, since the
explanations of the field encompass more and more phenomena.

But as [John Gray has demonstrated](https://kirkcenter.org/reviews/after-liberalismfaith/),
we simply have no reason to conclude that humanity's moral or political
life has a similarly progressive character. In fact, the idea it does
is an example of the error political philosopher Eric Voegelin
termed ["immanentizing the eschaton,"](https://www.ncregister.com/blog/dont-immanentize-the-eschaton)
or trying to bring the kingdom of heaven down to earth.
So the right response, if someone tells you, "You're behind the times on
this issue," is "The times have repeatedly been wrong in the past, and so they are now."
