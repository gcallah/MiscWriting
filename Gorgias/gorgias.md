# Gorgias: Plato's Guide to Online Discussions


In Plato's dialogue *Gorgias*, Socrates discusses the art of oratory with several prominent sophists:
Gorgias, Polus, and Callicles.
The sophists claimed to be able to teach their students how to persuade others of whatever they wanted them to
believe, so that those students could win court cases, forward their own political agendas, and so on. Socrates
calls into question the sophists' assumption that getting one's way is the highest achievement in life.
For instance, he argues that committing a crime and then getting away with it through oratorical skill is actually
*worse* for the criminal who is punished, since the latter is might actually be healed of his
wrongdoing by accepting his punishment as just.

Along the way, Socrates encounters many of the same rhetorical stunts that we will run into on the Internet today.
For example, early in the dialogue, Socrates says to Gorgias:

"I suppose, Gorgias, that like me you have had experience of many arguments, and have observed how difficult the parties find it...
to come away from the discussion mutually enlightened; what usually happens is that, as soon as they disagree and one
declares the other to be mistaken or obscure in what he says, they lose their tempers, and accuse one another of
speaking from motives of personal spite..."

Socrates could just as easily deliver the same remarks today to anyone who has engaged in a few discussions on Facebook or
X. It typically takes only a few rounds of back-and-forth before somebody is accusing someone else of being a fascist,
a racist, a communist, or a brain-washed MAGA cultist.

But Socrates also offers the remedy to this malady, at least for oneself:

"I am one of those people who are glad to have their own mistakes pointed out and glad to point out the mistakes of
others, but who would just as soon have the first experience as the second; in fact, I consider being refuted the
greater good, in as much as it is better to be relieved of a very bad evil oneself, then to relieve another."

And I suppose, dear reader, that like me you've had the experience of trying to discuss something with an
interlocutor, who continually wanders off to deliver a long diatribe on another
issue only tangentially related to the topic under discussion. What's worse, if you try to return his attention to the
issue at hand, he accuses you of stifling his freedom of speech.
Socrates, also, is only too familiar with this tactic, and knows how to handle it. When he warns Polus to "keep in check
the loan speeches with you and Barton at the beginning of our conversation," Polus responds, "What? Am I now allowed to
say as much as I choose?"

Socrates replies:

"It would certainly be hard luck, my good friend, if on arriving in Athens, which allows freedom of speech above all
other cities in Greece, you found that you alone were denied that privilege. But, just look at the other side, think
what hard luck it will be for me if, when you're making a long speech and refusing to answer the questions put to you,
I am not allowed to go away and get out of hearing."

That's right: Socrates pioneered the "Mute" button, to be clicked on whenever you find yourself in a "conversation" with
someone who won't stop babbling on about whatever bee is currently in their bonnet.

And which of us has not posted what we believe to be a cogent argument on some topic, only to be met with "LOL" as a
response? Socrates had: when he tells Polus that the man who establishes a tyranny is more miserable than the man who
tries to establish one, but fails, and is punished, Polus's response is to laugh. But Socrates points out the emptiness
of such a response: 

"What's this, Polus? Laughing? Is this a new type of proof, laughing at what your opponent says instead of giving reasons?" 

And surely many of our readers have engaged someone in an online discussion, and presented strong evidence
that the first assertion that person made in the discussion is nonsense. But rather than either acknowledging that fact,
or presenting counter-evidence, they merely switch topics by making a brand new assertion, unconnected to their first
one. And if that one is proven false, they just...  switch the topic again!

Socrates encountered this exact problem: "Oh, oh, Callicles, what a rogue you are! You're treating me like a child,
changing your ground from moment to moment, to mislead me."

If you are skeptical about our country plunging into yet another war, very frequently, people in favor of the war will
accuse you of supporting whoever it is you don't want to fight: so anyone who was against intervening in Bosnia in the
1990s must have been pro-Milosevic, anyone against Obama's airstrikes in Syria pro-Assad, and anyone urging peace in
Ukraine pro-Putin. But that tactic seems to be at least 2400 years old, since when Socrates criticizes Pericles,
Callicles tells him, "The people who tell you that are pro-Spartans with cauliflower ears, Socrates." (The
"cauliflower ears" is a reference to the Spartan's love of boxing.)

Another common tactic employed in Internet discussions, when someone argues for an unpopular opinion, is to tell that
person to "read the room." So, for instance, if you say, "I think that in vitro fertilisation is morally problematic,"
you may be met with something like: "Read the room: even Trump favors IVF!"

But Socrates knew that "the room" is a very unreliable meter with which to gauge the truth or justice of some position. He knew
that the sophists often would "pander to the souls of a crowd, without regard to what is best for them."

He then asks Callicles:

"Do the orators in your opinion speak always with an eye to what is best, and make it the constant aim of their speeches
to improve their fellow-citizens as much as possible, or do they to o set out merely to gratify the citizens,
sacrificing the public interest to their own personal success, and treating the assemblies like children, whom their
only object is to please, without caring at all whether their speeches make them better or worse?"

And Callicles admits that there are many orators who indeed do not care whether they genuinely help their listeners.

Socrates then points out that the power to persuade a *demos* (a people) will involve becoming like that *demos*,
and if the people are corrupt, that will involve becoming corrupt oneself. As he says, "Each *demos* takes pleasure in
hearing sentiments which are in harmony with its own nature and detests the reverse."
Thus, contrary to those who declare that the "marketplace of ideas" will select the best ideas, what wins out in that
marketplace is whatever ideas bolster the self-image of the people being addressed, regardless of their truth.
And seeking popularity in that marketplace can itself make one resistant to truth, as Socrates warns Callicles: "the
love of *demos* in your soul, Callicles, is putting up resistance to my argument"

Finally, Socrates, anticipating his own death sentence at the hands of the Athenian people, describes how a doctor who
does what is best for his patient, however unpleasant that treatment may be, could easily lose out in a court of law to
a panderer who only offers patients what is pleasurable to them.

Although engaging in online discussions today is often vexing, it might be a relief to know that the problems we
face are not unique to our age, and that Plato offered us a guide for how to cope with them 2400 years ago.
