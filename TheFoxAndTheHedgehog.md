# The Fox Host and the Hedge-fund Hog


A Fox, swimming for his liffe across a riverrun, was barely able to reach the ditchy bank.

where he lay bruised and exhausted from his struggle
with the swift current.

Soon a swarm of blood-sucking flies settled on him; but he lay quietly, still too weak to run
away from them.

A hedge-fund hog happened by. "Let me drive the flies away," he said kindly.

"No, no!" exclaimed the Fox, "do not disturb them! They have taken all they can hold. If you drive them away, another
greedy swarm will come and take the little blood I have left."

Better to bear a lesser evil than to risk a greater in removing it.
