# Gorgias: Plato's Guide to Internet Discussions


Gorgias is a dialogue by Plato, in which Socrates discusses the art of oratory with several of Athens
popular sophists, namely, Gorgias, Polus, and Callicles.
The sophists were men who claimed to be able to teach people how to persuade others of whatever they wanted them to
believe, so that their students could win court cases, forward their own political agendas, and so on. Socrates is going
to call into question the sophists assumptions, for instance, by denying that acheiving an unjust result that supposedly
is in one's own interest is truly good.

Early in the dialogue, Socrates says to Gorgias:

"I suppose, Gorgias, that like me you have had experience of many arguments, and have observed how difficult the parties find it...
to come away from the discussion mutually enlightened; what usually happens is that, as soon as they disagree and one
declares the other to be mistaken or obscure in what he says, they lose their tempers, and accuse one another of
speaking from motives of personal spite..." (20)

Socrates could just as easily deliver the same remarks today to anyone who has engaged in a few discussions on Facebook or
X. It typically takes only a few rounds of back-and-forth before somebody is accusing someone else of being a fascist,
or a racist, or a communist.

But Socrates also offers the remedy to this malady:

"I am one of those people who are glad to have their own mistakes pointed out and glad to point out the mistakes of
others, but who would just as soon have the first experience as the second; in fact, I consider being refuted the
greater good, in as much as it is better to be relieved of a very bad evil oneself, then to relieve another." (20)

And I suppose, dear reader, that like me you've had the experience of trying to discuss something with an
interlocutor, who continually wanders off to deliver a long diatribe on another
issue only tangentially related to the topic under discussion. What's worse, if you try to return his attention to the
issue at hand, he accuses you of trying to prevent him from expressing his opinion.
Socrates, also, is only too familiar with this tactic, and knows how to handle it. When he warns Polus to "keep in check
the loan speeches with you and Barton at the beginning of our conversation," Polus responds, "What? Am I now allowed to
say as much as I choose?"

Socrates replies:

"It would certainly be hard luck, my good friend, if on arriving in Athens, which allows freedom of speech above all
other cities in Greece, you found that you alone were denied that privilege. But, just look at the other side, think
what hard luck it will be for me if, when you're making a long speech and refusing to answer the questions put to you,
I am not allowed to go away and get out of hearing." (28-29)

That's right: Socrates pioneered the "Mute" button, to be clicked on whenever you find yourself in a "conversation" with
someone who won't stop babbling on about whatever bee is currently in their bonnet.

Which of us has not posted what we believe to be a cogent argument for some conclusion, only to be met with "LOL" as a
response? When Socrates tells Polus that the man who establishes a tyranny is more miserable than the man who tries to establish
one, but fails, and is punished, Polus's response is to laugh. But Socrates points out the emptiness of such a
response: 

"What's this, Polus? Laughing? Is this a new type of proof, laughing at what your opponent says instead of giving reasons?" 

And surely many of our readers have engaged someone in an online discussion, and presented strong evidence
that the first assertion that person made in the discussion is nonsense. But rather than either acknowledging that fact,
or presenting counter-evidence, they merely switch topics by making a brand new assertion, unconnected to their first
one. And if that one is proven false, they just...  switch the topic again!

Socrates encountered this exact problem: "Oh, oh, Callicles, what a rogue you are! You're treating me like a child,
changing your ground from moment to moment, to mislead me." 92

If you are skeptical about our country plunging into yet another war, very frequently, people in favor of the war will
accuse you of supporting whoever it is you don't want to fight: so anyone who was against intervening in Bosnia in the
1990s must have been pro-Milosevic, anyone against Obama's airstrikes in Syria pro-Assad, and anyone urging peace in
Ukraine pro-Putin. But that tactic seems to be at least 2400 years old, since when Socrates criticizes Pericles,
Callicles tells him, "The people who tell you that are pro-Spartans with cauliflower ears, Socrates." (118)



In the "marketplace of ideas," it is most often those who pander to people's base nature who win out.

"Then it is quite possible to pander to the souls of a crowd, without regard to what is best for them?" 96


"Do the orators in your opinion speak always with an eye to what is best, and make it the constant aim of their speeches
to improve their fellow-citizens as much as possible, or do they to o set out merely to gratify the citizens,
sacrificing the public interest to their own personal success, and treating the assemblies like children, whom their
only object is to please, without caring at all whether their speeches make them better or worse?" 98



"we can win happiness only by directing all our own efforts, and those are the state to the realization of justice and
self discipline, not by allowing our desires to go unchecked, and, in an attempt to satisfy them, evil without end,
leading the life of an outlaw." 107

"an orator in the proper sense" 107

112: life extension fanatics


114: the power to persuade a populous will involve becoming like that populous, and if it is corrupt, will involve becoming corrupt oneself


"Each demos takes pleasure in hearing sentiments which are in harmony with its own nature and detests the reverse" 114

So what wins out in the "marketplace of ideas" is whatever ideas bolster the self image of the people in that marketplace, not whichever ideas are true or best.


"That is because the love of demos in your soul, Callicles, is putting up resistance to my argument" 115


 128: pandering


Accepting Plato's case here does not yield any simple conclusion about freedom of speech. Restricting it, of course, as its own problems, such as allowing a repressive regime to silence, political opponents. But it does mean that we can not rely on the fictitious "marketplace of ideas" to move people towards the truth.
