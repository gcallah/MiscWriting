# An Empire if You Can Keep It

## A Non-Ideological Empire


The Romans did not have to ideologically defeat every culture they brought into their empire. They only required that
they acknowledged the empire's sovereignty.

Americans should really just acknowledge that their government rules an empire, and the government folks might admit it as well.

Then the question would become, "How can we rule this empire most prudently and justly?"

And at that point we'd be having a genuine discussion.


The one failing of their tolerance was the Christians. And that was because Christianity, because of its strict monotheism, did not permit its
adherents to pay homage to the ancient gods of the Roman polity. The many polytheistic societies Rome had conquered were
allowed to keep all of their local gods and traditional rites, so long as they added into those the appropriate civil

If the rulers of our empire recognized its proper role as currently best institution for preventing widespread violence
and anarchy, They would understand that, leaving local parts of the empire alone as much as possible, is one of the best
ways to fulfill there is stewardship

It's an attractive fantasy, but it ain't gonna happen.



Maybe: 

Of course: because "international law" is a just an international suggestion without an international sovereign ready to enforce that law.
