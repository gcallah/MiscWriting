# An Empire if You Can Keep It


## We Could not Keep It

When Elizabeth Willing Powel encountered Benjamin Franklin exiting the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia,
she reportedly asked him, "Well, Doctor, what have we got, a republic or a monarchy?"

He answered her, "A republic, if you can keep it."

We were not able to keep it. At some point in the nineteenth century, certainly by the time we took possesion of Puerto
Rico and the Philippines, we had become an empire. This sort of thing has happened before. History offers us no
evidence that the process is reversible.

I swam competitively for a number of years. I achieved my best times at about the age of 25 or so.
I would love to be able to swim that fast again, and it's an entertaining fantasy to imagine that I could.

But it's just that: a fantasy. While I might be able to get in better shape than I am today, I cannot undo 41 years of
aging. My body will never perform like it was 25 again, at least until the final resurrection.

Hoping to get back to the republic of the 1820s (or whatever other era the defender of small-r republicanism idealizes)
is like me hoping to match my swimming times from when I was 25. It's an attractive fantasy, but it's not
going to happen.

The fact of the matter is that America is today a global empire. While nostalgic longing for some republican era of the
past is understandable, actually pinning one's hopes on a revivification of that corpse is not healthy.

And we have a very good cautionary example of the folly of pretending that some past political form can be reincarnated in
the changed circustances of the present. As I argue in
*Oakeshott on Rome and America*, the spirit that had animated the Roman Republic had been well dissipated by the time of
Julius Caesar's ascendancy. There was no realistic possibility of restoring the old republic.

Brutus, Cassius, and Cato are often potrayed as civic heroes in our literature. In fact, their inability to recognize
that their imagined republic could not be recreated led to years of civil war, and even made the situation worse for
themselves and all their supporters. Julius Caesar, after taking power, was willing to make
peace with (*Optimates*)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimates_and_populares],
forgiving those who had opposed him, leaving them alive and not without status or property.

In gratitude, the *Optimates* assasinated Caesar. As a consequence they faced the second triumvirate of Octavius, Marc Antony, and
Lepidus, who, having learned the lesson that their opponents could not be trusted, had them killed, drove them to
suicide, or robbed them of all their possesions and left them destitute.

Analyzing that situation using Vilfredo Pareto's theory of (the circulation of elites)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulation_of_elites]
is informative: the *Optimates* were a declining elite who were trying to retain their elite status,
while the *Populares* were a rising elite. The first *Populare* to take power, Julius Caesar, offered the members of the
declining elite an olive branch. Failing to recognize that this was the best offer they were going to get, the
*Optimates* rejected it, and instead were essentially wiped out.

One important fact about the empire that falling upon the Roman civil wars is that it was not an ideological empire.
Let's look at what that means.

## A Non-Ideological Empire

As Michael Oakeshott wrote in his *Lectures in the History of Political Thought*, the Romans believed that they were
"blessed by the gods... their destiny to rule the world and impose a civilization and an orderliness upon its
barbarisms." The pragmatic folks that they were, their emphasis was on imposing order, not on forcing all of the
subcultures within their empire to adopt Roman ideas. As a result, they did not require every culture they
brought into their empire to adopt some Roman "ideology.: They only required that they acknowledged the empire's
sovereignty.

The one failing of their tolerance was the Christians. And that was because Christianity, because of its strict
monotheism, did not permit its adherents to pay homage to the ancient gods of the Roman polity. The many polytheistic
societies Rome had conquered were allowed to keep all of their local gods and traditional rites, so long as they added
into those the appropriate civil performance of homage to the Roman gods.


Jewish monotheism escaped the fate of Christianity because it was old, clearly older than Rome, and the Romans
respected things that had endured. (They had an early understanding of the Lindy effect.)
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect)

But besides that one large faling, the Romans in general did not concern themselves with how the residents of some
conquered territory conducted their lives: they could 

Daniel McCarthy points out that the Monroe Doctrine was similarly non-ideological: 

"The Monroe Doctrine was not primarily ideological. It did not specify that the United States expected to see certain
kinds of governments in Latin America or elsewhere in the Americas."

## An Empire That Hides Its Reality Behind an Ideology


Wilson

Spreading democracy


Many of the adherents of Wilsonianism were sincere. But the problem is that 

constantly punished if democracy is not spreading, and that locale..


How much the actors in this play intended result, what, in fact, happened, was that the states meeting the "democratic,
liberal capitalist" criterion became dependent upon US defense.


## The Benefits


Trump is casting off Europe as part of the American Empire.



## Objections

### Against Empire Building


One person to whom I showed an early sketch of this essay didn't approve because he "objected to empire building." But this
is like objecting to the deforestation of the island of Manhattan: it's too late; it has already happened. Objecting to
American empire building might have made good sense in 1848 or 1898, but today, it is already built. The question is
what do we do with it?

A possible answer is to surrender our empire, and pull our military back within the borders of the US. But that answer
lacks prudence: following its advice would create a power vacuum, and power vacuums get filled. The most likely result
would be China stepping in to fill it.

When the Western Roman empire finally fell apart, the result was not liberation, but the dark ages. Townspeople inside the
empire had lived down in the fertile river valleys: when the empire was gone, they moved up into fortified hill towns.





### It Is Better to Be Hypocritical Than Unashamedly Bad

In an essay entitled ("Venezuela killed the U.S.")[https://arnaudbertrand.substack.com/p/venezuela-killed-the-us], Araud
Bertrand contends that although the U.S. intervened in Latin America to create regime change "at least 41 times," at
least in the previous instances, the U.S. was hypocritical about its motives: "The story a nation tells itself is not
trivial - it is everything."

That is a weird contention on its face: surely that story is not "everything," and what the nation actually does is of
at least some importance, right? Many of the Nazis were probably telling themselves that their work in the concentration
camps was for the greater good: is that really more important, let alone "everything," compared to the fact that they
were committing genocide?

Bertrand goes on to argue that the virtuous story we told ourselves about those earlier
interventions was, like most hypocrisy, "vice paying tribute to virtue," which is surely better than unapologetic vice.
However, we are not in the situation in which it is ambiguous as to whether America has an empire, one 
where the forces for and against an imperial America are in flux, and paying lip service to Wilsonian ideals 
while acquiring an empire might tilt the balance in favor of "no empire."

The situation is actually more like one in which someone has sired a large number of illegitimate children. Probably it was
best if he hadn't done so.
But he *did* sire them, and now they exist.
While the philandering husband might've been justified in paying lipservice to marital fidelity whilst he was
out fooling around, once he has actually sired children, failing to acknowledge that reality is no longer "vice paying
tribute to virtue," but "vice failing to take responsibility for its actions."

and only has fathered his legitimate children? Or do he admit that he has a whole bunch of other children for whom he is
responsible, and choose to live up to that responsibility?

The question of whether we ought to have acquired an empire is an interesting one, but I will not deal with it at all
here, because I am interested in what to do about the reality that we *have* acquired one. *While* we were acquiring it,
perhaps it *was* better that we usually pretended we were "promoting liberty," or something of the sort. 

But now that we have an empire, pretending that we do not renders us incapable of talking about how to manage that
empire as prudently and justly as possible.



### The State Should Guide Us Morally


Ideally, of course, but recently, the states main role in that area has been to misguide us morally.

If the rulers of our empire recognized its proper role as currently best institution for preventing widespread violence
and anarchy, they would understand that leaving local parts of the empire alone as much as possible is one of the best
ways to fulfill there stewardship, as well as lessening resistance to their rule.


## Conclusion

Americans should really just acknowledge that their government rules an empire, and the government folks might admit it as well.

Then the question would become, "How can we rule this empire most prudently and justly?"

And at that point we'd be having a genuine discussion.




## Notes



If we admit we have an empire, we might be able to define its borders so others would know when they were stepping across them.



Ahmari:

"One rift inside the foreign-policy restraint camp is between:

(A) Jeffersonian small-r republicans;

(B) essentially American primacists who believe in pursuing different priorities than those long preferred by liberal Atlanticists.

I have some (A) in me, but mostly I'm a (B)."



Maybe: 

Of course: because "international law" is a just an international suggestion without an international sovereign ready to enforce that law.


There is no true law, in the city of man, without a sovereign to enforce that law.

"international law" is a just an international suggestion without an international sovereign ready to enforce that law.
