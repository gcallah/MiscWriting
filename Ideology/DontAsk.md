# Forbidden Questions

Imagine your political party happens to be sending space heaters to people in the tropics.
Naturally, someone not committed to your party's platform may ask "Why?"
From what I have witnessed recently on X.com, the appropriate response
is to scream at them "You are so insecure you can't even stand the idea of people different from you,
living in the tropics, can you? You don't want people in the tropics to even exist!
And I bet the shape of the space heaters makes you think of your own pathetic, inadequately sized..."
Well, you get the idea, and you've probably seen this kind of thing yourself.

What in the world is going on with this unhinged sort of response? Why don't the people psychoanalyzing the questioner
simply answer the question? And why do so many other people find these sort of responses worthy of a social media
"like"?

The German-American political philosopher Eric Voegelin provided us with an illuminating analysis of this sort of
"answer" to a seemingly simple question. His starting point is his characterization of ideologies as constructions of
"dream worlds." By that he meant that the ideologue builds an imaginary world that functions as they wish the real world
would. For instance, a communist imagines a world in which people are entirely altruistic, need no motivation to work
besides their desire to benefit their comrades, and have no attachment to the things they produce. This dream may
describe the Kingdom of Heaven or a world entirely populated by Christian or Buddhist saints, but fails badly in
matching up to the world we actually find ourselves living in.

However, the ideologue finds meaning in their dream world that they do not find in reality, and so they wish to make reality
conform to their dream, rather than facing reality themselves. But what happens when reality intrudes upon the dream;
when, for instance, the kulaks (Russian farmers who owned their own farms)
are not thrilled to surrender all of the fruit of their labor to the dictatorship of the
proleteriat? In order to preserve the dream world, the ideologue must condemn reality, and those benighted enough to
insist on living in reality rather than in the ideologue's dream. As Stalin put it, the kulaks should be "liquidated."

Here, the ideologue faces a problem: how to answer the kulaks simple question, "I put all of the work into raising these
potatoes; why aren't they, therefore, *my* potatoes?" As Voegelin noted, the solution was simply to forbid the asking of
such questions, by attacking the character of the person who dared to ask them. In the Soviet Union, the kulaks'
protests  were dismissed by calling them "bloodsuckers," "pariahs," or "vermin." And, of course, no one has to answer a
question posed by a cockroach or a leech!

Today, we often can see the same strategy at work on social media.
I would like to offer a couple of examples of forbidden questions that I have witnessed recently on x.com.
The first one is usually found on the right, and concerns vaccines. I am genuinely open to the
idea that some vaccines might have harms that outweigh the benefits -- pharmaceutical companies have been known to cut
corners in testing! Thus, when I see posts from people who are
"vigorously" anti-vaccine, I will often ask questions that seem to me to be perfectly reasonable. So if I see someone
claiming that pharmaceutical companies knew that their vaccines were deadly, but released them anyway, I might ask, "Why
would these companies want to kill their own customers?" Of course, in a shortsighted quest for profits, a company might
rush a product to market without taking reasonable care that it is not harmful. A famous case of this was
[thalidomide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalidomide#History), which caused many birth defects before removed from
the market. But the makers of the drug were not trying to cause birth defects, they were simply reckless.

Another sort of claim that I have sometimes questioned asserts that something bad that happened to someone who had been
vaccinated have been caused by the vaccination. An apparently healthy athlete drops dead of a heart attack during a competition.
Subsequently, someone will post, "See: the vaccine killed him!" Absent any further evidence,
this is clearly an instance of the [*post hoc ergo
propter hoc*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc) fallacy. And the obvious question is "What
evidence do you have that the vaccine was responsible?"

I don't ever recall receiving a sensible response to either question. Instead, the answers are howls of outrage and
vituperation. For instance, it is common that someone immediately claims that I am "in the pocket of big pharm."
Another typical response is, "If you won't see the truth, then go ahead and get the vaccine like a good little sheep!"
Well, I can assure readers that I have never received a penny from "big pharm" in my life. And whether I choose to get
some vaccine or not is hardly relevant to justifying the claim that some unfortunate young person's sudden death was
caused by a vaccine they had received.

A second case, again most seen among people who consider themselves right-of-center, centers around the idea that seed
oils, such as canola, sunflower, or soybean oil -- oils very common in processed food and fried food from restaurants --
are "toxic" and are causing a wide variety of ailments. For instance, one tweeter claims that seed oils:

- increase stress
- increase estrogen
- lower testosterone
- toxic [sic] to liver
- lead to inflammation
- blocks [sic] glucose use
- accelerates [sic] aging
- breaks [sic] down into toxins linked to alzheimers and cancer
(https://x.com/AlpacaAurelius/status/1510288335339765761)

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. himself claims that "seed oils are one of the driving causes of the obesity epidemic,"
and that Americans are being "poisoned" by them.
(https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1848499491151745180)


"has allowed these unhealthy ingredients to dominate the food supply."
Why? Their must be lobbies for and corporate profits to be made in beef tallow, lard and butter, right? Why did seed
oils win?


My third example arose when some people asked why Minnesota governor Tim Walz wanted to mandate
putting tampons in the boys' bathrooms of state schools. Now, there is some ambiguity as to whether the law he signed
really *did* mandate that. (The law says that there must be tampons
"in restrooms regularly used by students in grades 4 to 12 according to a plan developed by the school district."
But does that mean in *all* bathrooms used "by students in grades 4 to 12"? Or is it OK to have them in only
*certain* bathrooms? It is worth noting that when Republican legislators tried to change the bill to only require
tampons in girls' bathrooms, their attempt failed.)

But for our purposes whether the law really requires tampons in boys' bathrooms
is actually irrelevant: in the discussions I witnessed, everyone, both the
pro-Walzers and the anti-Walzers, was assuming that the law *did* require tampons in boys' bathrooms.
Rather than answer what seems to be a reasonable question, "Why should boys' bathrooms stock tampons?"
pro-Walz respondents attacked the people asking it, saying that they "are disgusted by girl's bodies," are "weird," 
or that they want high school girls to be humiliated by bleeding through their clothes because no tampons are available.
Not one of these responses answers the question asked. Granted,
girls menstruate, and need something to help with that event, so why not make sure tampons are adequately stocked in the
*girl's* bathrooms, unisex bathrooms, and in the nurse's office as well? In the very small number of cases where someone
who identifies as a boy is menstruating, that person could simply go the nurse's office or a unisex bathroom.

Many people defending what they took to be Walz's position -- that the law did, indeed, require tampons in boys'
bathrooms -- forwarded narratives where a guy who carried tampons in his backpack for when his female friends
needed one "would be overwhelmed with prom invites." Let's look at the "dream world" nature of this response: First of
all, it claims that high school girls are attracted to high school boys not because they are the star quarterback or the
frontman for a hot local band, but because they carry tampons in their backpack. Secondly, there is the idea that high
school girls happily share their menstrual condition with their male friends. Does anyone out there ever recall hearing
a high school girl saying to one of her male friends, "Hey, I'm having a really heavy flow today. Do you have a tampon
on you?"

The posters who find the above a plausible scenario are living in a dream world, a world in which there are no real,
meaningful differences between males and females, in which are girl experiencing a "heavy flow" is just as likely to ask
the HS football team's center for a tampon as she is likely to ask her female friend or the school nurse.

But what is particularly of note is the refusal to answer simple questions: "Why put tampons in the boys'
bathroom?" or "Why would a business deliberately kill its own customers?" or "What evidence do you have that this death was
actually related to a vaccine?"
Whenever we see such an avoidance of questions like these, we are confronting an ideological dream world.
