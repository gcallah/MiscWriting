# Gorgias: Plato's Guide to Internet Discussions



In the "marketplace of ideas," it is most often those who pander to people's base nature who win out.

"Then it is quite possible to pander to the souls of a crowd, without regard to what is best for them?" 96


"Do the orators in your opinion speak always with an eye to what is best, and make it the constant aim of their speeches
to improve their fellow-citizens as much as possible, or do they to o set out merely to gratify the citizens,
sacrificing the public interest to their own personal success, and treating the assemblies like children, whom their
only object is to please, without caring at all whether their speeches make them better or worse?" 98

When Socrates tells Polus that the man who establishes attorney is more miserable than the man who tries to establish
one, but fails, and his punished, Polus's response is a hearty "LOL." But Socrates points out the emptiness of such a
response: 

"What's this, Polus? Laughing? Is this a new type of proof, laughing at what your opponent says instead of giving reasons?" 


Probably many of our readers have experience meeting someone in an online discussion, and presenting strong evidence
that the first assertion they makein the discussion is nonsense. But rather than acknowledging that fact, the person
immediately switches the topic by making a brand new assertion. And if that one is proven false, they merely...
switch the topic again!

Socrates encountered this exact problem: "Oh, oh, Callicles, what a rogue you are! you're treating me like a child,
changing your ground from moment to moment, to mislead me." 92



"we can win happiness only by directing all our own efforts, and those are the state to the realization of justice and
self discipline, not by allowing our desires to go unchecked, and, in an attempt to satisfy them, evil without end,
leading the life of an outlaw." 107

"an orator in the proper sense" 107

112: life extension fanatics


114: the power to persuade a populous will involve becoming like that populous, and if it is corrupt, will involve becoming corrupt oneself


"Each demos takes pleasure in hearing sentiments which are in harmony with its own nature and detests the reverse" 114

So what wins out in the "marketplace of ideas" is whatever ideas bolster the self image of the people in that marketplace, not whichever ideas are true or best.


"That is because the love of demos in your soul, Callicles, is putting up resistance to my argument" 115

The accusation that one favors the enemy:

"The people who tell you that are pro-Spartans with cauliflower ears, Socrates." 118


 128: pandering


Accepting Plato's case here does not yield any simple conclusion about freedom of speech. Restricting it, of course, as its own problems, such as allowing a repressive regime to silence, political opponents. But it does mean that we can not rely on the fictitious "marketplace of ideas" to move people towards the truth.
