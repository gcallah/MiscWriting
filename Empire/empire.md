An Empire if You Can Keep It





The Romans did not have to ideologically defeat every culture they brought into their empire. They only required that they acknowledged the empire's sovereignty.

Americans should really just acknowledge that their government rules an empire, and the government folks might admit it as well.

Then the question would become, "How can we rule this empire most prudently and justly?"

And at that point we'd be having a genuine discussion.


If we admit we have an empire, we might be able to define its borders so others would know when they were stepping across them.



Ahmari:

"One rift inside the foreign-policy restraint camp is between:

(A) Jeffersonian small-r republicans;

(B) essentially American primacists who believe in pursuing different priorities than those long preferred by liberal Atlanticists.

I have some (A) in me, but mostly I'm a (B)."



Hoping to get back to the republic of 1820 (or whenever) is like me hoping to match my swimming times from when I was 25.

It's an attractive fantasy, but it ain't gonna happen.



Maybe: 

Of course: because "international law" is a just an international suggestion without an international sovereign ready to enforce that law.


There is no true law, in the city of man, without a sovereign to enforce that law.

"international law" is a just an international suggestion without an international sovereign ready to enforce that law.
