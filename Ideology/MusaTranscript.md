
Eugene Callahan: so. 1st of all, let me say congratulations on writing such an excellent book.

5

Musa al-Gharbi: Oh, thank you!

6

Callahan: A couple of things to

7

Callahan: perhaps disagree with you on. But

8

Callahan: the the wealth of material you assembled in defense of your thesis is really impressive.

9

Callahan: I think there's what 45 pages of footnotes something like that.

10

al-Gharbi: Yeah.

11

Callahan: How long did you work on this.

12

al-Gharbi: Longer than I had planned to. But that's because I actually ended up writing 2 books. So when I when I initially pitched it to

13

al-Gharbi: Princeton. I thought it was gonna take 6 months

14

al-Gharbi: and and that was crazy in retrospect because I didn't under appreciate how different writing a book is, then it's not like writing 10 papers or something. It's completely but because it was already largely systematizing a lot of other research. I did. I thought I could turn around in 6 months, but I sold it in May 2021. I just went got published in, you know, October of this year? So

15

al-Gharbi: close to 3 years working on it. And then, you know, some time in in queue. But yeah, so basically what I, what I wanted to do in the initial pitch to Princeton and I was going to spend about half the book looking at symbolic capitalists and the social order that we preside over and the ways we legitimize, our power, grabs and all.

16

al-Gharbi: And then at the second half, I was going to turn the analytic lens from the winners in the knowledge economy towards those who perceive themselves to be the losers. And I was going to argue that so looking at

17

al-Gharbi: people who are sociologically distant from us, people who are living in small towns or more suburban areas, or people who or more rural areas, people who do jobs where they're providing physical goods and services to people.

18

al-Gharbi: and so on and so forth. And the basic argument of the second half of the book

19

al-Gharbi: was going to be that a lot of political things that we think of as kind of separate stories. The diploma divide the urban rural divide the diploma divide gender, divide. These are all just proxies for this more fundamental

20

al-Gharbi: divide in American society, which, in my analysis, is between

21

al-Gharbi: a symbolic capitalism, people who feel

22

al-Gharbi: alienated from the social order that we preside over. And then

23

al-Gharbi: Likewise, I was gonna argue that things like

24

al-Gharbi: the rise of Populist leaders, like trump, or the crisis of expertise or tensions around identity, politics, and so on. These are likewise different fronts in the same struggle, which is the the real struggle which is between symbolic capitalists and people who feel alienated from the world. And so that's just going to be a second book. Now, it's probably going to be called those people.

25

al-Gharbi: Oh, yeah, right?

26

Callahan: Alright well, I'll let you know that.

27

Callahan: You're far from the champion of missing a deadline. Do you know about Eric Vogland's History of Political Thought.

28

al-Gharbi: No, I haven't read that book. Know.

29

Callahan: Well, it you can't read it, because it never came out. He contracted to do a 200 page book that would be delivered in a year

30

Callahan: and 14 years later. He's corresponding with his publisher, saying he had written 4,500 pages so far.

31

Callahan: so I also heard about someone submitting a book 50 years late to one of my

32

Callahan: cheers.

33

al-Gharbi: In my case. I told them initially, they were like, send us 90,000 words, 3 or 5 target around that length, and I was like, I can't write 90,000 words about anything. So I negotiated down to 70,

34

al-Gharbi: and then I gave them a manuscript that was 210,000. So I wrote both books. They're already done. We just cut it in half, basically more or less. And and then kind of, you know, adjusted things so that each each stands as its own as a freestanding work. But but yeah, so the the second book is basically done. I'm going to be shopping it out here.

35

al-Gharbi: Now that we have starting to get some sales, some preliminary sales data on how the 1st book did we can.

36

al-Gharbi: we're actually.

37

Callahan: So we should see that fairly soon, I hope.

38

al-Gharbi: Got with it.

39

Callahan: Yeah, excellent. So because this will appear in a journal where we don't expect everyone to have read your book. Unfortunately, maybe it would be worthwhile to discuss.

40

Callahan: because this interview will serve as an intro for many of the readers to what you're talking about.

41

Callahan: Perhaps it would be good to

42

Callahan: do a little intro to what a symbolic capitalist is, and what you see as the cultural contradictions of this new elite.

43

al-Gharbi: Yeah. So symbolic capitalists have been known by other names and by other scholars. So they've also been called the professional managerial class. The creative class Class XA whole bunch of them, the new class, a whole bunch of them, involve class. For reasons I explain on my sub stack, I actually don't think class is the right. I don't think they actually cohere into being a class in the traditional way that class was understood.

44

al-Gharbi: And so that's 1 of the reasons I I didn't stick with one of the existing terms.

45

al-Gharbi: but but basically symbolic capitalists are people who make a living by manipulating symbols and data and rhetoric

46

al-Gharbi: and images and and things like this, there are people who don't provide physical goods and services to people. And so if you want to like a nutshell way to think of

47

al-Gharbi: who symbolic capitalists are to think about people who work in fields like science and technology, education, finance and consulting law, human resources, and so on and so forth. The cultural contradictions of the new elite. So the book is trying to basically

48

al-Gharbi: highlight a handful of contradictions.

49

al-Gharbi: the core one, probably the one that kind of anchors, the rest of the question that the books, the rest of the question, the books are trying to is trying to analyze is that

50

al-Gharbi: starting at the beginning of these professions when they started to form into into professions as we understand them today. So this was in the interwar period between World War one and World War 2. So starting then

51

al-Gharbi: and accelerating after the 19 sixties and the move away from industry. We saw the rise of

52

al-Gharbi: symbolic capitalists started gaining a lot more influence and affluence over society. The global economic order shifted in favor of what you might call the symbolic professions and away from traditional industry.

53

al-Gharbi: And

54

al-Gharbi: one of the things that's interesting about that move is that symbolic capitalists. From the beginning of our professions we've defined ourselves in terms of altruism and serving the common good. So stick with my own professions.

55

al-Gharbi: Journalists are supposed to follow, you know, be a voice for the voiceless, and speak truth to power, and academics are supposed to follow the truth wherever it leads, and, to tell the truth, without regards to economic and political considerations, and so on, and so forth.

56

al-Gharbi: And if you look at who in America

57

al-Gharbi: it's most likely to

58

al-Gharbi: self-identify as an anti-racist, as a feminist, as an ally to Lgbtq. People, as an environmentalist who's most likely to carry them. So engage in the modes of discourse and

59

al-Gharbi: self presentation and interaction that people call woke

60

al-Gharbi: it's symbolic capitalists. And

61

al-Gharbi: and so what you might expect, given our strong social justice, orientation that has been present, for you know.

62

al-Gharbi: since the beginning of our professions, is, as people like us

63

al-Gharbi: have more power and influence over society we would expect to see along a lot of social problems being ameliorated, we would expect to see growing trust in institutions, and as a result of all the great work that we're doing, and so on and so forth. Instead, we see the opposite. In many respects a lot of persistent, a lot of social problems have persisted or even grown worse.

64

al-Gharbi: we see increasing institutional dysfunction, increasing distrust in institution, increasing social mistrust, growing affective polarization, and so on. And so the core question, really, that the book is trying to wrestle with is like, Well, what's

65

al-Gharbi: what's going on here? Why do we see what we see, instead of what we promised and expected, and maybe hoped would happen, as we got more power over society, and there are some a number of subordinate puzzles, then, that the book is wrestling with, but I would say, that's the cool one.

66

Callahan: Excellent. So I have 2 follow-up questions to that answer. The 1st is to why do the symbolic capitalists not form a class? In what way they fail. So maybe class is an ideal type in the Weberian sense, right? So all

67

Callahan: actual phenomena conforms more or less to an ideal type.

68

Callahan: But, you're saying that this

69

Callahan: is less so than maybe the industrialists right? Or the proletariat? Why is that.

70

al-Gharbi: For a few, a few reasons. So so one of the things that makes us classy

71

al-Gharbi: is that we do tend to have

72

al-Gharbi: convergent issue convergent interests on a number of issues like

73

al-Gharbi: intellectual property rights, or,

74

al-Gharbi: you know, investments in infrastructure and

75

al-Gharbi: we tend to cluster in some of this, some similar communities. We live and take part in this set of interrelated institutions like nonprofit, higher. Ed, and you know, media, and so on.

76

al-Gharbi: But but yeah, one of there are a few reasons why we don't cohere well into being a class per se, though, despite

77

al-Gharbi: the classy, the classy bits of us. One of them is that

78

al-Gharbi: there's this

79

al-Gharbi: basically biplication within the symbolic professions where you have

80

al-Gharbi: basically one track of people who have

81

al-Gharbi: a lot of prestige, a lot of autonomy, a lot of

82

al-Gharbi: they basically.

83

al-Gharbi: And you have, like really high pay, and you have other people who make, you know, a lot less. They have a lot less autonomy. In fact, they're mostly executing other people's visions. They have a lot less prestige. They still have more than Normie workers. And actually, this is one way in which we consistently misunderstand our own class position, a lot of symbolic capitalists who are like adjunct instructors, or and so on, who are kind of the lower end of this

84

al-Gharbi: of this bifurcation.

85

al-Gharbi: tend to think of themselves as kind of poor, and you know something like that. And the only reason they can even think of themselves that way is because they just really have no understanding of how most of the rest of America lives.

86

al-Gharbi: It looked like what Normie jobs look like. The kinds of income that most Americans make, and so on. But set that to the side

87

al-Gharbi: and and and another thing that's really unique about us is that we? We tend not to really think about ourselves.

88

al-Gharbi: as a class. As as Seamus Kahn, said my advisor, he argues,

89

al-Gharbi: like one of the most defining things about us

90

al-Gharbi: is that we tend to think of ourselves as like excellent individuals, we define ourselves in terms of our merit and our individualistic striving, and so on. And in fact, a lot of our institutions select for people who have these kinds of individualistic understandings of themselves and these individual individualistic narratives. They tell we're especially weird to use a term from Joe Henrik. And so yeah, we don't really have

91

al-Gharbi: Despite convergent interests.

92

al-Gharbi: we don't really

93

al-Gharbi: operate and coordinate as a class in a meaningful way. We don't really think of ourselves as a class in a meaningful way, and so on, and so forth. And there is this kind of deep schism within that that prevents. So at best, we're kind of a class in formation, but we've

94

al-Gharbi: it's but we've we've not been able to really cohere that way because of this deep division that that lies within the symbolic provisions.

95

Callahan: What

96

Callahan: I would think that one of the problems the Marxists always had was actually getting the proletariat to

97

Callahan: conceive of themselves as a class. So this is not new.

98

al-Gharbi: Yeah, yeah.

99

Callahan: Alright but the second follow up question is at the end of the book

100

Callahan: you spend some time

101

Callahan: defending the sincerity of the commitment to social justice, and so forth, of the symbolic capitalists.

102

Callahan: I wonder? So as I was. I've actually written a book review as well, because preparing for the interview, I really realized I had enough notes that I might as well publish a book review, and what I wrote there was, if I continue to tell you that I'm really committed to sobriety.

103

Callahan: but every night you find me in a bar.

104

Callahan: after a while.

105

Callahan: Do-do, we

106

Callahan: does. Maybe I'm suffering from false consciousness of some sort. Right?

107

Callahan: I'm deceiving myself about my sincerity. So

108

Callahan: I know that symbolic capitalists will assert that they're very tied to these values. But after a certain point.

109

Callahan: are we entitled to say, Well, you're not putting your money where your mouth is, you? You seem to defend them against that charge, and I wonder if that defense is fully justified.

110

al-Gharbi: Well, I think what I'm really trying to push back against are 2 things, one, there's this in the culture wars, this tight focus on hypocrisy. I think hypocrisy is actually analytically uninteresting, and

111

al-Gharbi: and in part because pretty much everyone is a hypocrite. If you believe in something, you're basically a hypocrite. And there's a lot of reasons for that. I highlight that briefly in the book and then more in my subset.

112

al-Gharbi: So I don't think this kind of conversation about hypocrisy or different sides are pointing at each other. You're a hypocrite. No, you're a hypocrite like I just think that's not a useful way of understanding.

113

Callahan: Everyone except me like, but.

114

al-Gharbi: And

115

al-Gharbi: and well, and then so I think 2 things are true.

116

al-Gharbi: about symbolic capitalism. One, just because you believe something sincerely doesn't mean something is important to you, right? So you can have a sincere belief. But it's just not a thing. So you can think like, oh, it's great if the homeless people are all off the street. I don't. I don't think that most

117

al-Gharbi: most Americans want homeless people in their neighborhood, or so on and so forth, or I don't think they want to see people struggling to survive and things like that. But solving that problem that doesn't mean that you're feeling in that way. That doesn't mean that's a really big priority for you in your life to fix it.

118

al-Gharbi: And then, you know, a related issue is that the

119

al-Gharbi: while it's absolutely true, I think that symbolic capitalists are sincere in their commitments to social justice that's not their only sincere commitment. They're also sincerely committed to being an elite, which is to say, they think that we think that our perspective should count more than the person checking us out at the grocery store, we think we should have a higher standard of living than Walmart workers, and we want our children to reproduce our own class position. And this sincere set of beliefs and desires is

120

al-Gharbi: in deep tension with the other set of social justice, oriented beliefs and desires. It's hard to be an elite, an egalitarian social climber right those 2. And so often when these 2 sincere beliefs come into conflict, as they often do, it's the desire to be an elite that ends up, winning out and supervening how we pursue social justice, leading us to

121

al-Gharbi: pursue social justice in largely symbolic ways, or to pursue social justice by trying to expropriate, you know, take things from others, and expropriate blame onto others, without

122

al-Gharbi: making any meaningful sacrifices or risks, or whatever to how we live our own lives and what our own aspirations are. And so I think that's what's actually happening there. It's not that they're not sincere. It's that this isn't their only sincere commitment, and it's not their top sincere commitment. And then the last thing I'll say about on this point is, I wrote a thing

123

al-Gharbi: for my sub stack about a

124

al-Gharbi: Orwell's the road to Wigan Pier.

125

al-Gharbi: and he has actually a great quote.

126

al-Gharbi: That I include in in the substack post about

127

al-Gharbi: what he wants to highlight in this in this bit of of text is that

128

al-Gharbi: if you

129

al-Gharbi: he was, he was looking at one at what makes Socialism unappealing to a lot of Normies. And he said, one of the things that's really unappealing about Socialism to a lot of Normies is this like intense focus on things like automation and things like this. According to like Socialist understandings of like, there's this Utopian vision of today. They call it fully automated luxury communism, where

130

al-Gharbi: you know, where no one has to work anymore. And things like this. They think that's a paradise. Orwell says that would be hell. It would be hell. It would be miserable because actually, one of the ways that people find community meaning and purpose in life is through work. Work isn't just the way that we pay the bills. There's this deep human need to be productive to do things that are valuable and to produce things, and so on. And a lot of the Socialists say. Well, you know.

131

al-Gharbi: under fully automated luxury, social communism. There's nothing that would stop you from working. If you want to work, you know you could go ahead. You could do that. But the truth is, Orwell argued, even if that was technically a possibility, no one's going to do it in practice. What they would do, what they would end up doing is spending that time of trying to fill that hole

132

al-Gharbi: with drugs and alcohol, and entertaining themselves to death, and things like this. And the fact that most people would do that doesn't mean that this is what they want. They want to just get drunk and high and entertain themselves to death.

133

al-Gharbi: But but that's what they would end up doing, because there's, you know, social defaults are strong and other things like this. And anyway, I think this quote from Orwell is a powerful point about how like people can do things and embrace states of affairs that they

134

al-Gharbi: that they detest, or they can fail to live up to

135

al-Gharbi: the things that they say they value, or that they're important, and that that doesn't necessarily mean

136

al-Gharbi: that they don't actually believe those things. It's just again, there's all sorts of things that frustrate our

137

al-Gharbi: our desires to to see a certain type of society, or to live a certain way.

138

Callahan: Your remarks about that tension remind me as a visiting Phd. Student at Nyu, and I was attending 2 colloquiums. One was Mario Rizzo's Free Market Oriented

139

Callahan: Colloquium, which met in a small cramped room with kind of crappy tables, with a view out at another building and no amenities. And then Thomas Nagel and Ronald Dwarkins, very egalitarian seminar colloquium, which met in a very luxurious room with leather back chairs and pictures of my sweater, and a view out over Washington Square Park. And I thought, it's kind of funny that the egalitarians have

140

Callahan: so much nicer accommodations than the free market people.

141

Callahan: okay,

142

Callahan: let's

143

Callahan: Now, there, in the beginning of the book, sometimes

144

Callahan: you start to.

145

Callahan: I started to feel that

146

Callahan: do. Does anyone actually believe in anything, or are they just acting in their self interest? Well, you you dealt with sincerity. But there, there is a sense

147

Callahan: that

148

Callahan: So was it in your class interest to write this book, for instance. So what?

149

Callahan: How do we sort out that you know.

150

al-Gharbi: Yeah, I mean it definitely was, I mean, part of the reason. For instance, I wrote it.

151

al-Gharbi: I I mean, I have this set of questions that I'm interested in and whatever but, like also part of the reason I wrote it published it with Princeton University Press is because I'm on the tenure track, and you know, and and in fact, one of the things that

152

al-Gharbi: that's you know. Interesting about the book is that in some ways it's actually a physical embodiment of some of the very things that I like. It's a literal, direct, physical embodiment of a lot of the things that I criticize. So, for instance.

153

al-Gharbi: one of the things that the book highlights is the use of educational credentials, and especially credentials from elite schools to to sort out who deserves to be worth hearing and taking seriously which perspectives are valuable and so on.

154

al-Gharbi: Okay, but you know,

155

al-Gharbi: this is a book that I targeted at prestige University Presses, and the reason why this book was picked up was in no small part. Because I am. I was myself affiliated with Columbia University. If I was a Phd. Student at University of Arizona or Stony Brook, even if I sent in the exact same manuscript, changing absolutely nothing.

156

al-Gharbi: It's likely that the book the book probably wouldn't have gotten picked up by anyone, let alone Princeton. There probably wouldn't have been a competitive auction for the rights, and so on in the same way that

157

al-Gharbi: before I was at university well, when I was at University of Arizona, I would pitch to places like the New York Times and stuff, and I wouldn't even get a no, I was below rejection.

158

al-Gharbi: And then, when I moved to Columbia I had editors from the New York Times and the Washington Post reaching out to me cold, hey? Would you like to write something about bled for the Washington Post? And it wasn't because I became a much better writer, and the time it took to move from Sierra Vista to Manhattan it's purely network effects, institutional effects. And so on. And the same is actually true with respect to race and ethnicity. So one of the things that the book highlights is the ways that symbolic capitalists leverage

159

al-Gharbi: their association with marginalized and disadvantaged groups to advance their own interests. But a reality is that part of the reason that this book was a was published. It was published in the form it was, and so on is because I'm black

160

al-Gharbi: like. It's not the case that everyone who's black gets a Princeton book, but if I wasn't black, if I was a white, if I had written the exact same book

161

al-Gharbi: as a white person, especially if I had any hint of

162

al-Gharbi: conservatism or Evangelical Christianity, or something like that about me, chances are this book wouldn't have been published even if I was just. A white Liberal. Chances are this book wouldn't have been published by this press, certainly not in its current form. It would have had a bunch of sensitivity, readers, and so on, and so forth, and so part of why I was able to publish this book in the form it was part of why this book was so attractive to a lot of publishers, and so on.

163

al-Gharbi: It's because I'm black. And so like the the book is itself in many respects

164

al-Gharbi: like a literal, direct embodiment of a lot of the things I criticize in the pages, and rather than just pretending like. That's not true. I think it's important to just lean into that and wrestle with that contradiction. Apply it to myself reflexively.

165

al-Gharbi: Oh.

166

Callahan: Well, it's nice of you to provide a good example of what you're talking about for us.

167

al-Gharbi: Yeah.

168

Callahan: So writing the book not only brought forward the thesis, it exemplified the thesis at the same time so well done. Very Meta.

169

al-Gharbi: I'm a sociologist of knowledge, so I can't help

170

al-Gharbi: like get super mad at all times.

171

Callahan: All right. The book talks about racialized inequalities at a number of places.

172

Callahan: and

173

Callahan: I was wondering about that. Are you familiar with Gregory Clark's. The sun also rises.

174

Callahan: came out a decade or so ago.

175

al-Gharbi: The name is familiar, I wouldn't be able to speak confidently on it off the top of my head.

176

Callahan: Interesting book, and his main thesis, which I think surprised him. I think.

177

al-Gharbi: Thank you.

178

Callahan: I. I reviewed this, but it was a decade ago, but as I recall, he actually

179

Callahan: discovered this in researching it, and was rather surprised by he was trying to show that the different degrees of social mobility in different societies, and wound up, discovering that the social mobility was kind of constant across societies, and that elite status tended to persist for many generations. So you know, he went back into the Doomsday Book

180

Callahan: and found that some of the same names are still prominent at Cambridge and Oxford. Right? It it very well researched.

181

Callahan: And so when we look at the

182

Callahan: racial characteristics of the elite in the Us.

183

Callahan: How much of this could be explained simply by the fact that 200 years ago.

184

Callahan: essentially, if you were elite in the us you were white.

185

Callahan: right, and that this elite status persists.

186

Callahan: and what we see is simply this persistence. Now we could try. We could try to pull this apart from race itself.

187

Callahan: for instance, by seeing if how, how likely is the are the descendants of a poor white family and a poor black family, how likely are they to have attained elite, status.

188

al-Gharbi: Yeah.

189

Callahan: Right? So what do you think about how much of this is any current racial issue?

190

Callahan: Aside from just the fact that all all the elites were white, you know, a few generations ago, and so naturally today more of them are.

191

al-Gharbi: Yeah, I wrote about this a little bit. So, for instance, for Heterodox Academy, I had an essay looking at the composition of the professoriate along the lines of race and gender, and so on. And and this is one of the things that I argued is that.

192

al-Gharbi: like one of the big obstacles to diversifying the professorate is that these are lifetime appointments, and society changes a lot faster than there's turnover in terms of the lifespan of people who work in these professions. And so, even in the absence of formal discrimination, you can see this pattern where the professorate will be unrepresentative, and actually in some respects

193

al-Gharbi: increasingly unrepresentative of society as a whole, even in the absence of formal discrimination, and so on. And, in fact, there is a great paper

194

al-Gharbi: that was published in the National Bureau of Economic Research.

195

al-Gharbi: recently.

196

al-Gharbi: I forget her name. But what she showed is that

197

al-Gharbi: even in a world where there was no Jim Crow.

198

al-Gharbi: where there was no segregation, where there was none of that

199

al-Gharbi: actually, you would expect to see significant black white income gaps for some of these same reasons. Okay.

200

al-Gharbi: so there is. So an element of these disparities is is as a result of this kind of path, dependency, elite reproduction, and so on. But one of the things that's interesting

201

al-Gharbi: is that, if you look at the symbolic

202

al-Gharbi: professions, and if you look at some of these macro social trends, like part of what's happening is actually, there's this, as Richard Reeves called it, opportunity hoarding by people who are elites to protect and preserve their elite status, to create glass floors for their children, to make sure their children reproduce their status

203

al-Gharbi: in ways that undermine things like social mobility, and so on and so forth. So in a world where, in the absence of this kind of rigging of a lot of markets, this kind of cartel-like behaviors, as I show. One of the things I show in the book is that

204

al-Gharbi: if we, if

205

al-Gharbi: if the knowledge economy followed traditional supply and demand things.

206

al-Gharbi: One thing that you would expect to see for a lot of service jobs. It's hard to even find enough people to work those jobs.

207

al-Gharbi: and for a lot of knowledge economy jobs, there's this huge overproduction. So take higher. Ed, for instance, professors, there's this huge glut of people who want to be professors, and there's not nearly enough jobs. And so traditional supply and demand

208

al-Gharbi: laws worked. Then what you would expect to see is that the pay for professors would be going down, the pay of service workers would be going up radically, and especially relative to one another. There would be instead, what you see is that they actually the gap between professors and service workers is growing bigger. Professors are actually doing better and better relative to service workers whose wages are relatively stagnant, at least compared to

209

al-Gharbi: the knowledge economy workers. And so this isn't just the market and path dependency. And this kind of stuff just working its normal way, and like normal reproduction. This is actually caused in some respects by a lot of cartel, like behaviors and opportunity hoarding and other things like this that actually prevent the kind of churn among the leads that would actually be necessary to

210

al-Gharbi: allow some of these problems to mitigate themselves over time. So instead of them getting better over time. They actually persist in some cases grow worse because of active choices that we make today, not carryovers from Jim Crow, not carryovers from slavery, not carryovers from racial redlining, but because of decisions that we make today that exacerbate various forms of inequality, and, in fact.

211

al-Gharbi: a lot of the professions

212

al-Gharbi: that are like hyper woke, and so on. They tend to be some of the places where these disparities are most pronounced. So in terms of race and ethnicity. The symbolic professions are some of the most parochial workplaces, as I show in some data tables in the whole country, and even in terms of things like gender. Although a lot of these professions have been feminizing at a pretty rapid rate, gender disparities between men and women

213

al-Gharbi: are actually bitter in the symbolic professions than they are in society writ large despite

214

al-Gharbi: the the fact that. And so, yeah, so I think part of it is the story of just kind of, you know, path dependency. You have the elites that looked one way, and then, you know, even in a fully, even in a situation where things were genuinely open and and procedurally fair, you would expect a degree of

215

al-Gharbi: the the initial distribution to persist for a while. So part of it is that. But part of it is also definitely not that it's choices that we're making today that exacerbate and perpetuate some of these actively perpetuate some of these unfortunate dynamics.

216

Callahan: Well, a certain amount of that path dependency is going to arise precisely from the fact that elites have power to make sure their own kids

217

Callahan: attain a lead status. Right?

218

al-Gharbi: And so this is my point is, yeah, it's not a situation where it's where you're talking about, like some kind of genuinely open, procedurally fair thing where it's just I mean. So even in a case where some people have advantages, they go to better schools, they have healthier diets. They live in better neighborhoods and things like that. Those are examples of like.

219

al-Gharbi: well, okay, well, that's kind of elite path dependency. A whole bunch of other people don't have those advantages, and so you would expect to see certain forms of inequalities reproduce themselves even in the absence of formal discrimination or cartel behavior, or anything like that.

220

al-Gharbi: But a lot of these disparities that I point in the book are not just that

221

al-Gharbi: they're actually clearly the result of cartel-like behavior, active exclusion, active decisions that people are making today. So, for instance, in some cities racial segregation is worse today than it was in the 19 eighties.

222

al-Gharbi: Now, that's not. You can't explain why things are worse today than they were in the 19 eighties because of racial redlining, or Jim Crow, or anything like that right? That can only be explained by choices that we made today. That took a trajectory that was going one way and turned it another way. So a lot of these problems are actually the result of active decisions we're making here and now, not just leftovers of the past.

223

Callahan: Yeah, I recall, and there was a proposal to merge

224

Callahan: one of the school districts in Brooklyn Heights

225

Callahan: that would make it incorporate the housing projects on the other side of Tillery. The residents of Brooklyn Heights exploded.

226

al-Gharbi: Yes, they were.

227

Callahan: Furious about this.

228

Callahan: so it the the racial aspect is interesting, you know. If if this had been a bunch of poor rural whites, they probably would have been just as upset. So

229

Callahan: it, you know, if

230

Callahan: and and if the neighborhood had had a bunch of wealthy black doctors, I think they wouldn't have minded at all so.

231

al-Gharbi: Yeah, absolutely well. And so this is so. Class is an important and in fact, some of the social justice, one of the cultural contradictions that the book highlights is that a lot of times we mobilize social justice, discourse.

232

al-Gharbi: and ways that actually help us justify inequalities in ways that help us explain why people who are losing and suffering under our prevailing order deserve their suffering, deserve to be marginalized. So example a lot of the narratives we tell about white privilege.

233

al-Gharbi: For one, we tell this kind of goofy story, where every white person has the same racial privilege. So someone who is a checkout counter who lives in Appalachia at Circle K has the same white privilege as a professional that lives in San Francisco, and as I show in the book. It's just not the case that everyone benefits in the same way from their race, even if they share the same race. That's just actually false. But setting that aside.

234

al-Gharbi: the reality is.

235

al-Gharbi: oh, when

236

al-Gharbi: when you look at what is teaching people about white privilege do, what effect does it actually have on people. It turns out there's a lot of empirical research on this, that teaching people about white privilege doesn't cause them to think about non-whites any differently. It doesn't cause them to behave any differently than they did towards non-whites. The main effect is that it causes them to look at poor whites.

237

al-Gharbi: and think that those people really must suck, they must really deserve their plight. They were born on 3rd base. They were born white. They had all this privilege and look at them. They're still poor. Okay?

238

al-Gharbi: And so this is a very convenient kind of narrative for elites to hold, because a plurality of poor people in the United States are white. And so, if you tell a story that allows you to write off the suffering of the lion's share of poor people in America, to say, not only

239

al-Gharbi: do we not have to worry about allocating anything to them because they were just wasted, they'd squander it. They were born with all this privilege, and what do they do with it? Right, but then also allows us to actually look at their suffering and think. Actually, in fact, maybe they have more than they actually deserve. Maybe they should have less than they have. We want to take from the whites right? So we tell these kinds of narratives that allow us to point at the people who are suffering and losing and

240

al-Gharbi: falling behind in the prevailing order, and to justify why they deserve their suffering, why they deserve their marginalization, why, we don't have to take that concern seriously. And so social justice on its face.

241

al-Gharbi: These narratives about white privilege

242

al-Gharbi: seem egalitarian seem social justice oriented. But in practice, when you look at how they're actually mobilized by elites, at their social life, it seems like more than anything what they end up doing in reality is helping us justify inequalities.

243

Callahan: They have to take from them until they learn to stop voting for trump.

244

al-Gharbi: Yeah. Well, they're gonna have to start taking from the blacks and Hispanics, too. In fact, that's been a big story over the last decade. Not just the last election.

245

Callahan: So I imagine we should wrap things up soon. I know you're having a busy day, and we've been at it for a while.

246

Callahan: this may be purely a artifact of your publishers requirements.

247

Callahan: but when

248

Callahan: John Gray and I were talking.

249

Callahan: we I brought up how

250

Callahan: so much of the social justice activity results in what's an empty gesture and rather than actually fixing a problem. And I said, You know it. It actually covers up for the fact that the problem is not being fixed.

251

al-Gharbi: Yeah.

252

Callahan: And does nothing. And John said, No, I think it's worse than doing nothing. It takes energy that could go into fixing the problems and instead rename something. So the homeless people are now unhoused.

253

Callahan: Yeah. So don't you feel better in that cardboard box now that you're unhoused instead of homeless? But throughout the book black is spelled with a capital B.

254

al-Gharbi: Yes.

255

Callahan: I just wonder is this the kind of gesture we should be resisting? Because I don't see that that's actually improved. A lot of people suffering in a terrible housing project. Hey? You're still in the terrible project. But we now stole your race with a capital B.

256

al-Gharbi: Yeah, absolutely. So that was the thing that the publisher did in my initial manuscript. I didn't capitalize the B

257

Callahan: I guess.

258

al-Gharbi: That's their standard. That's their standard practice. But also, you know, I didn't fight about it precisely for the reason that there's actually nothing at stake here, so if they want to capitalize it, and I don't want to capitalize. I didn't capitalize it. They want to capitalize it fine. I don't care. There's nothing at stake either way. If I insisted on keeping it lowercase, what would that accomplish? Nothing. So I was perfectly fine to let them do their own. I was more worried about, you know, more important, substantive things.

259

Callahan: Yeah, it's a it's a minor point. But

260

al-Gharbi: Yeah, no. That makes sense.

261

Callahan: To that extent where, if you go along, if I say you know, someone says to me, Don't, don't call them homeless. They're unhoused, and I go along with it. Am I pretending that there's a substantive change here?

262

al-Gharbi: And in the case of unhoused and homeless actually,

263

al-Gharbi: there, there's actually a an actual

264

al-Gharbi: problem. So I would actually push back about that in part, because there's actually a lot of research that shows euphemisms actually make people more comfortable with adverse states of affairs. Actually, if you call them unhoused instead of homeless. What you're doing in some ways is actually obscuring the brutality of the conditions that they're living under. It makes it easier for people to tolerate that kind of thing. So if they wanted to replace a bunch of stuff in the book with euphemisms, I would

265

al-Gharbi: probably I would have probably pushed back against that that would actually cut against the point of the book. But but something like a stylist, if you capitalize lowercase something that's the kind of thing that I don't care about, you know.

266

Callahan: Yeah. Like, like, I said, there's a very minor point that just struck me. Okay, well, I've taken up a good bit of your time, and I'm you're having a very busy day, so I do appreciate you. Taking the time to talk with me.

267

al-Gharbi: It was a lot of fun. Actually, I'd be happy to, you know. Talk to your to your review as well. But yeah, no feel free to be happy, to talk more downstream. But okay.

268

Callahan: Thank you. Bro.

269

al-Gharbi: Alright. Thank you.

270

Callahan: Take care!

271

al-Gharbi: Alright! Go ahead!
