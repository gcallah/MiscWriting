A Semiotic View of Artificial Intelligence: There's No Thirdness There

Gene Callahan

Abstract

Various sceptical authors have addressed question of whether AI genuinely is thinking now,
or will ever think. While I think that many of their arguments are perfectly sound,
they involve first getting the reader to engage in some metaphysical thinking.

But the discipline of semiotics provides a way to demonstrate that there is a fundamental
gulf between the way a human interacts with the world and the way a machine does so.
That is because humans do not interact with the world in strictly dyadic relationships:
they exhibit Peirce's "thirdness," which, as he demonstrated, cannot be decomposed into simpler, dyadic relationships.

But computers, even when executing programs that may be called "artificial intelligence,"
exhibit only dyadic relationships: their output is literally meaningless
until it enters into a relationship of thirdness with a human being. And since engaging
in semiosis is at the core of intelligence, this demonstrates that there's no "there" there in AI.
