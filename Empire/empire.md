# An Empire, if You Can Keep It

When Elizabeth Willing Powel encountered Benjamin Franklin exiting the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia,
she reportedly asked him, "Well, Doctor, what have we got, a republic or a monarchy?"

He answered her, "A republic, if you can keep it."

We were not able to keep it. At some point in the nineteenth century, certainly by the time we took possesion of Puerto
Rico and the Philippines, we had become an empire. This sort of thing has happened before. History offers us no
evidence that the process is reversible.

I swam competitively for a number of years. I achieved my best times at about the age of 25 or so.
I would love to be able to swim that fast again, and it's an entertaining fantasy to imagine that I could.

But it's just that: a fantasy. While I might be able to get in better shape than I am today, I cannot undo 41 years of
aging. My body will never perform like it was 25 again, at least not until the final resurrection, after which I expect
my 1650 freestyle time will be remarkable.

Hoping to get back to the republic of the 1820s (or whatever other era the defender of small-r republicanism idealizes)
is like me hoping to match my swimming times from when I was 25. It's an attractive fantasy, but it's not
going to happen.

The fact of the matter is that America is today a global empire. While nostalgic longing for some republican era of the
past is understandable, actually pinning one's hopes on a revivification of that corpse is not healthy.

And we have a very good cautionary example of the folly of pretending that some past political form can be reincarnated in
the changed circustances of the present. As I argue in
*Oakeshott on Rome and America*, the spirit that had animated the Roman Republic had been well dissipated by the time of
Julius Caesar's ascendancy. There was no realistic possibility of restoring the old republic.

Brutus, Cassius, and Cato are often potrayed as civic heroes in our literature. In fact, their inability to recognize
that their imagined republic could not be recreated led to years of civil war, and even made the situation worse for
themselves and all their supporters. Julius Caesar, after taking power, was willing to make
peace with [*Optimates*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimates_and_populares),
forgiving those who had opposed him, leaving them alive and not without status and property.

In gratitude, the *Optimates* assasinated Caesar. As a consequence they faced the second triumvirate of Octavius, Marc Antony, and
Lepidus, who, having learned the lesson that their opponents could not be trusted, had them killed, drove them to
suicide, or robbed them of all their possesions and left them destitute.

Analyzing that situation using Vilfredo Pareto's theory of [the circulation of elites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulation_of_elites)
is informative: the *Optimates* were a declining elite who were trying to retain their elite status,
while the *Populares* were a rising elite. The first *Populare* to take power, Julius Caesar, offered the members of the
declining elite an olive branch. Failing to recognize that this was the best offer they were going to get, the
*Optimates* rejected it, and instead were essentially wiped out.

One important fact about the empire that followed the Roman civil wars is that it was not an ideological empire.
Let's look at what that means.

## A Non-Ideological Empire

As Michael Oakeshott wrote in his *Lectures in the History of Political Thought*, the Romans believed that they were
"blessed by the gods... their destiny to rule the world and impose a civilization and an orderliness upon its
barbarisms." The pragmatic folks that they were, their emphasis was on imposing order, not on forcing all of the
subcultures within their empire to adopt Roman ideas. As a result, they did not require every culture they
brought into their empire to adopt some Roman "ideology." They only required that they acknowledged the empire's
sovereignty.

The main group falling outside the scope of Roman tolerance was the Christians.
And that was because Christianity, due to its strict
monotheism, did not permit its adherents to pay homage to the ancient gods of the Roman polity. The many polytheistic
societies Rome had conquered were allowed to keep all of their local gods and traditional rites, so long as they added
into those the appropriate civil performance of homage to the Roman gods. The Romans would have similarly allowed
Christians their own practices, except for their steadfast (and to the Romans inexplicable) refusal to perform the
required civic rituals.

Jewish monotheism escaped the fate of Christianity because it was old, clearly older than Rome, and the Romans
respected things that had endured. (They had an early understanding of the Lindy effect.)
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect)

Daniel McCarthy points out that the Monroe Doctrine was similarly non-ideological: 

"The Monroe Doctrine was not primarily ideological. It did not specify that the United States expected to see certain
kinds of governments in Latin America or elsewhere in the Americas."

## An Empire That Hides Its Reality Behind an Ideology

In stark contract to the Roman Empire, the American Empire has often been highly ideological, .


President McKinley justified the U.S. taking possession of the Philippines based up the civilizing effect of being
conquered by Anglo-Saxon people, rather than Spaniards:

"It is our proud title to belong to the Anglo-Saxon race, the leaders in the march of civilization, in every age and in
every quarter of the globe where that race enters it always remains, bringing with it the blessings of greater health
and happiness, of a larger and more perfect fertility and of freer interchange with the commerce and arts of the world.
It proclaims liberty; it establishes law; it enshrines religion and hastens progress; it makes the world the better for
its being."

-- McKinley, [draft of undelivered speech](https://direct.mit.edu/isec/article/48/2/49/118109/The-Meddler-s-Trap-McKinley-the-Philippines-and)

But the result of our rule their produced the Marcos kleptocracy and some of the lowest living standards in East Asia.
Despite years of communist rule in China and Vietnam, both countries nevertheless have significantly higher GDP per
capita than does the Philippines.


Woodrow Wilson famously justified our entry into World War I by arguing that "The world must be made safe for democracy."
[Here.](https://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/4943/)

Instead, that war made the world ripe for some of the worst, most despotic regimes ever to occupy the Earth, and created
decades of chaos in places like the Balkans.

George W. Bush used similar rhetoric to justify the wars the US was waging in Afghanistan and Iraq, for example, boasting of how
"With the steady leadership of President Karzai, the people of Afghanistan are building a modern and peaceful
government."

https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/11/20031106-2.html

Of course, the war there would continue another two decades and the end result was the reestablishment of Taliban
control. So we have a reckless expenditure of lives and resources in pursuit of an ideological fantasy.







How much the actors in this play intended the result, that, in fact, happened, was that the states meeting the "democratic,
liberal capitalist" criterion became dependent upon US defense.


## The Benefits


One benefit of admitting that we have an empire would be a clarification of the status of various portions of it. The
Romans for instance had a spectrum of relationships with various parts of their empire: a territory could be classified
as 

- Independent allies, such as Numidia
- Client kingdoms, e.g., Judea
- Free cities, like Athens
- Tributary communities 
- Latin rights territories (intermediate between ally and full citizen)
- Municipia
- Colonies
- Provinces

It is notable that most of these statuses allowed a large degree of self governance. What was not tolerated was directly
acting against the interests of the empire as a whole, so that after, for instance, a Numidian King went to war with
Rome, Numidia lost its status as an independent ally. Naturally, a people could no longer be an independent ally if they
were no longer an ally at all.

An American empire which saw its job primarily as keeping order within its borders would, in fact, be much more open to
true localism than is our current regime. With our government vacillating between trying to promote some left-wing
ideology and trying to promote some right-wing ideology, it repeatedly interferes with local governance to promote the
ideology *de jour*.
A pragmatic empire would recognize that many of the issues the American Empire becomes involved with are irrelevant to
its proper end: maintaining order. The Romans would not, for instance,
have cared if Lusitania permitted gay marriage while Armenia did not, if Arabia used racial preferences in hiring
while Britannia did not, or if Dacia adopted a socialist economic system while Mauretania enthusiastically embraced free
markets.

Another important benefit of recognizing our real situation would be that the American government could recognize that
some territories that have been *de facto* within the empire really should be regarded as outside it. The main consequence
of such a recognition would be that the US military would cease being the primary defender of those territories. Perhaps
this is what the Trump administration is doing with regard to Europe: Donations of Europe, or not particularly happy
with American hegemony, and the United States is spending a lot of money defending these unhappy client states.
Yet Europe has plenty of wealth and manpower to defend its own independence from, say, Russia, or China. So a realist
audit of the current boundaries of the empire could well recommend pulling back from Europe.

## Objections

### Too Machiavellian

Some might argue that my recommendation is "too Machiavellian," because:

1. Leaves America with no inspiring purpose that might unite its people; and/or:
2. Ignores morality and adopts a Machiavellian view of government as merely a matter of capturing and keeping power.

In regards to the first, why isn't being the power that brings relative order to what would other wise be a fractious
anarchy an inspiring purpose? In a cosmos tending towards disorder, creating order is a genuine accomplishment. And, as
[John Gray argues](https://www.newstatesman.com/ideas/2025/10/how-to-save-british-liberalism), this sort of
"Hobbesian liberalism" is, in fact, the most plausible and as well as the most genuinely libertarian version of
liberalism available to us.

And contra the charge of amorality, the realist view of the current American situation takes morality much *more*
seriously than does the morally kitsch notion that we are really, in our hearts, just James Stewart trying to make his
hometown better, but who accidentally found himself establishing military bases in 80 or 90 countries.


is moral, in that it
prudentially acknowledges that the American empire can conceivably achieve one large moral purpose: to bring a halt to
the "war of all against all" within its borders. However, should it instead (as it often does at present) strive to
spread some ["comprehensive doctrine"](https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2019/entries/rawls/#ReaCit) across its
empire, it will:

1. Fail in that attempt (due to the tremendous diversity of peoples within the empire) and even worse,
2. Cripple its ability to perform the moral task it really can perform, since the attempt will foster resentment among
   peoples not inclined to go along with the latest crusade launched from Washington.

Dan McCarthy (in the same podcast linked to above) notes that the Trump administrations recent intervention in
Venezuela, in fact, is grounded in this realist approach:

"The primary US interest is not in the kind of regime that may exist in a place like Venezuela... [our limited aim is]
we're going to take out someone like Maduro who is causing problems for us."

In other words, Venezuela's status as an independent ally was put at risk when Maduro repeatedly acted to subvert the
order prevailing in the western hemisphere, by sponsoring revolutionary activities in other states and allying itself
with extra-hemispheric powers such as Iran, Russia, and China.



### Against Empire Building


One person to whom I showed an early sketch of this essay didn't approve because he "objected to empire building." But this
is like objecting to the deforestation of the island of Manhattan: it's too late to object: it has already happened. Objecting to
American empire building might have made good sense in 1848 or 1898, but today, the empire is already built. The question is
what do we do with it?

For those who wish America were still a small-r republic, a possible answer to that question is,
"surrender our empire, and pull our military back within the borders of the US."

But that answer
lacks prudence: following its advice would create a power vacuum, and power vacuums get filled. The most likely result
would be China stepping in to fill it.

When the Western Roman empire finally fell apart, the result was not liberation, but the dark ages. Townspeople inside the
empire had lived down in the fertile river valleys: when the empire was gone, they moved up into fortified hill towns.
And, ironically, many of the German tribes whose incursions into the Western Empire resulted in its dissolution actually
had the aim of living inside the empire, since that was a more desirable existence.


### It Is Better to Be Hypocritical Than Unashamedly Bad

In an essay entitled ["Venezuela killed the U.S."](https://arnaudbertrand.substack.com/p/venezuela-killed-the-us), Araud
Bertrand contends that although the U.S. intervened in Latin America to create regime change "at least 41 times," at
least in the previous instances, the U.S. was hypocritical about its motives: "The story a nation tells itself is not
trivial - it is everything."

That is a weird contention on its face: surely that story is not "everything," and what the nation actually does is of
at least some importance, right? Many of the Nazis were probably telling themselves that their work in the concentration
camps was for the greater good: is that really more important, let alone "everything," compared to the fact that they
were committing genocide?

Bertrand goes on to argue that the virtuous story we told ourselves about those earlier
interventions was, like most hypocrisy, "vice paying tribute to virtue," which is surely better than unapologetic vice.
However, we are not in the situation in which it is ambiguous as to whether America has an empire, one 
where the forces for and against an imperial America are in flux, and paying lip service to Wilsonian ideals 
while acquiring an empire might tilt the balance in favor of "no empire."

The situation is actually more like one in which someone has sired a large number of illegitimate children. Probably it was
best if he hadn't done so.
But he *did* sire them, and now they exist.
While the philandering husband might've been justified in paying lipservice to marital fidelity whilst he was
out fooling around, once he has actually sired children, failing to acknowledge that reality is no longer "vice paying
tribute to virtue," but "vice failing to take responsibility for its actions."

The question of whether we ought to have acquired an empire is an interesting one, but I will not deal with it at all
here, because I am interested in what to do about the reality that we *have* acquired one. *While* we were acquiring it,
perhaps it *was* better that we usually pretended we were "promoting liberty," or something of the sort. 

But now that we have an empire, pretending that we do not renders us incapable of talking about how to manage that
empire as prudently and justly as possible.


### The State Should Guide Us Morally


Ideally, of course, but recently, the states main role in that area has been to misguide us morally.

If the rulers of our empire recognized its proper role as currently best institution for preventing widespread violence
and anarchy, they would understand that leaving local parts of the empire alone as much as possible is one of the best
ways to fulfill there stewardship, as well as lessening resistance to their rule.


## Conclusion

Americans should really just acknowledge that their government rules an empire, and the government folks might admit it as well.

Then the question would become, "How can we rule this empire most prudently and justly?"

And at that point we'd be having a genuine discussion.




## Notes



If we admit we have an empire, we might be able to define its borders so others would know when they were stepping across them.



Ahmari:

"One rift inside the foreign-policy restraint camp is between:

(A) Jeffersonian small-r republicans;

(B) essentially American primacists who believe in pursuing different priorities than those long preferred by liberal Atlanticists.

I have some (A) in me, but mostly I'm a (B)."



Maybe: 

Of course: because "international law" is a just an international suggestion without an international sovereign ready to enforce that law.


There is no true law, in the city of man, without a sovereign to enforce that law.

"international law" is a just an international suggestion without an international sovereign ready to enforce that law.
