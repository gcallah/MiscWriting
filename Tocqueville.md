# Did Tocqueville foresee America's current malaise?

## Abstract

In a *Commonweal* symposium on Patrick Deneen's *Why Liberalism Failed*, both
Deneen's critics, 
Samuel Moyn and Bryan Garsten of Yale University,
and  Deneen himself, focus an unusual amount of attention on how to correctly
interpret Alexis de Tocqueville's famous work, *Democracy in America*. Deneen again features Tocqueville
in a recent post on the *Postliberal Order* substack (2023).

Why, nearly 200 years after its publication, does this work still hold such
sway in discussing American politics? Well, for one thing, Tocqueville offered
certain prognoses that seem almost prophetic: that the expansion of the 
British population of North America across the continent was nearly inevitable,
or that the two great powers of the future would be the United States and
Russia.

But what is more important, in terms of "looking backward to move forward," are
Tocqueville's comments on the weaknesses and strengths of American democracy.
How many of the roots of our current malaise were already present when
Tocqueville toured the US? If the answer is, "Most of them," then it is not
useful to point the finger at Wilson, or FDR, or "the 60s," as bearing the
brunt of the blame for our current condition.

Therefore, re-examining the work of perhaps the greatest observer of American
democracy should prove helpful in our present situation.

## Introduction


## The Modern Litany of Sorrows

Numerous writers, I have placed the blame for America's current woeful state on various events in history. I will only
sign a few here, but I could have assembled dozens of sides for each point of blame.


### The Constitution

Perhaps the real root of our dificulties lies in the defeat of the anti-federalists by the supporters of the new US
Constitution? Such a view is forwarded by Murray Rothbard, as described in Gordon (2020).


### Marbury versus Madison

Was it the Supreme Court usurpation?

### The Civil War

Hummel contens that while the Civil War emancipated slaves, it also enslaved free men (2014).

### The Progressives

Or perhaps Woodrow Wilson and other early 20th-century progressives are to blame for how America has gone wrong? (E.g.,
Evers, 2015).


### The New Deal


### The Great Society


### Neoliberalism

Robert Putnam notes the decline of local social groupings in his 2014 work *Bowling Alone*.

Modern materialism and consumer culture.

### The Boomers

Helen Andrews lays the blame for our current plight squarely on "the boomers" (2021). Of course, such an analysis raises
the question, if the "boomers" are so aweful... what about the parents that raised them?


## Did Tocqueville Foresee the Above? (Most of it? Any of it?)

As Deneen writes, "Both ignore Tocqueville's insistence -- especially in Volume Two of Democracy in America -- on the
inexorable logic of "democracy" toward individualism, materialism, "restlessness," short-term thinking, and a kind of
civic infantilism fostered by a tutelary state" (2018, par. 2) 

### Materialism

"Carefully to satisfy even the least wants of the body, and to provide the
little conveniences of life, is uppermost in every mind" (signet 209)

"The desire of acquiring the comforts of the world haunts the imagination of
the poor, and the dread of losing them that of the rich" (signet 210)

"The passion for physical comforts is essentially a passion of the middle
classes..." (s 210)

"The love of well-being is now become the predominant taste of the nation..."
(s 211)

### Despotism

"After having thus taken each individual one by one into its powerful hands, and
having molded him as it pleases, the sovereign power extends its arms over the
entire society; it covers the surface of society with a network of small,
complicated, minute, and uniform rules, which the most original minds and the
most vigorous souls cannot break through to go beyond the crowd; it does not
break wills, but it softens them, bends them and directs them; it rarely forces
action, but it constantly opposes your acting; it does not destroy, it prevents
birth; it does not tyrannize, it hinders, it represses, it enervates, it
extinguishes, it stupifies, and finally it reduces each nation to being nothing
more than a flock of timid and industrious animals, of which the government is
the shepherd.

"I have always believed that this sort of servitude, regulated, mild and
peaceful, of which I have just done the portrait, could be combined better than
we imagine with some of the external forms of liberty, and that it would not be
impossible for it to be established in the very shadow of the sovereignty of
the people."  (1252)


Why?


### Individualism

Deneen again:
"As Tocqueville predicted of liberal democracy, individualism would be its primary fruit: 'Not only does democracy make
each man forget his ancestors, but it hides his descendants from him and separates him from his contemporaries; it
constantly leads him back toward himself alone and threatens finally to confine him wholly in the solitude of his own
heart'" (2023, par. 1).

## What did Tocqueville Get Wrong?

"If, on the other hand, you survey the infinite number of trading companies which are in operation in the United States,
and perceive that the Americans are on every side unceasingly engaged in the execution of important and difficult plans,
which the slightest revolution would throw into confusion, you will readily comprehend why people so well employed are
by no means tempted to perturb the State, nor to destroy that public tranquillity by which they all profit."
(Chapter VII: Connection Of Civil And Political Associations)

Written just 30 years before the Civil War.


## Conclusion

Imagine a coach full of passengers veering off the road and beginning to
descend a long hill. If the top of the hill is covered in soft grass and the
slope is mild, at first the passengers may not notice that anything has gone
wrong. It is only when, some ways down the hill, the coach hits a boulder, that
they first detect trouble. Later, doing a post mortem on their crash, some of
the passengers will identify striking that boulder as the moment when things
first began to go wrong. Some yards later, the coach hits an even larger stone.
Others of the passengers will identify that moment as the time their troubles
began. When a third, even larger rocky out cropping is struck, there will be
another faction who pointed that as the moment things went astray.

But, of course, their troubles actually began at the moment the coach left the
road. And if Tocqueville, in the 1830s, could look down the hill and foresee
the obstacles that lay ahead, then we know the coach had already left the road
by then.
