# Interview with Musa al-Gharbi


Elite over-production: "And the Roosevelt administration provided what they wanted."

But doesn't that increase demand?


Certainly people sometimes believe things because it is in their self interest to do so,
but I get an uneasy feeling as more things that start to be explained that way.
Did Marx *really* believe in scientific materialism, or was it just in his class interest to say he did?
Socrates?
Was it in your class interest to write this book?

What about Asians?


Isn't spelling Black with a B the kind of empty gesture you are discussing?


Should people feel guilty about using DoorDash, Uber, and Lyft? If the people working those gig jobs had a better
alternative, when they be doing that already?


You claim the "wealth" of Uber etc. is "derived" from the workers... but doesn't the software also account for a
portion of that wealth?
(I favor trying to set up worker-owned work sharing apps.)

Can universities really "set rents" at whatever level they want?


Rene Girard?



Colloquium difference


Formally qualified engineers.





some unfortunate manager asked a couple of black cooks to come up with a lunch for African-American history month. And
what they served was something like fried chicken, collard greens, black-eyed peas, and Kool-Aid. Now I regularly play
music in black churches in South Carolina, and except for the Kool-Aid (it would be sweet tea) this meal would be a big
hit at any of them. In fact, it would be a big hit with most white people down here as well.

And, in fact, it's a meal that would be eaten much more often by black Americans then what is served on St. Patrick's
Day is eaten by Irish Americans: my family, a corn, beef and cabbage exactly once per year, on St. Patrick's Day. And we
never drank green beer.

But a black student at our school complained, and the university pressured the catering company to fire somebody. It
wouldn't do to fire the black fellows who designed the menu, so they just went up the chain until they found a white
person, and fired him.

What is interesting to know here is that the person fired was a working class guy probably struggling to make ends meet
doing food service, while the complainant, being a student at a prestigious, engineering school, is destined for high
career earnings.
